Great for a date night. I got chicken nachos which were really tasty &amp; a large portion. I was able to bring leftovers home. My boyfriend got a steak quesadilla which started off great, but 2 of the slices had globs of a mysterious red sauce on it which didn&#39;t really work well. It tasted almost like marinara sauce, which needless to say was off putting for a quesadilla. He wasn&#39;t able to finish. Overall, food was yummy, &amp; I would go back. Just tell them to hold on the red sauce if you order quesadillas cause yikes.<br><br>Also, they have a daily HH 12-7 which I have to check out.

I really wanted to like this place, as I love Mexican food. While the service was friendly and nice, the food was prompt in arriving and the atmosphere is fun, the food is bland, uninspired and the alcohol tasted watered down. I don&#39;t know if the rave reviews are a result of the lack of options on the UES when it comes to Mexican food but the chef failed me. <br><br>My company and I enjoyed 3 (or four?) shots of their signature homemade pineapple tequila each AFTER 2-3 Happy hour drinks each and we both left a little buzzed. It seemed incredible that we weren&#39;t out of our minds. I would go for the drinks if I had to indulge my company, but would totally skip the food.<br><br>The bathrooms are super cute. You can definitely know that someone put thought and care into the decor.

My date had the enchiladas with steak and he ate it all and said it was good. So I'll take his word. I also had the red sangria and it was good and not light on the alcohol - super bonus. I would probably return again but would try something different. I wish they didn't only use shredded chicken/beef though the best Mexican dishes I've had used breast/chunks. for some reason shredded never does the trick.

I didn't eat much today and was starving, basically looking for something to hit the spot. When in doubt, I usually go Mexican. I've walked by Noche de Margaritas multiple times and was curious so I went with one of the dinner specials - timbolo de pollo and vegetables. Basically grilled chicken, rice, veggies, lettuce, guac and sour cream. As a resident fatty, I was ecstatic to see an enormous portion in front of my eyes. The grilled chicken was pretty yummy, but everything was pretty darn soggy by the time I was done with it. It was also inundated with melted cheese, which is saying a lot from someone who considers cheese its own food group. I would've liked to have had more guac - they REALLY skimped on it.

As soon as you walk in you are greeted by the friendly man saying \"hola\" to go along with the whole Mexican theme of the restaurant. The whole staff was super friendly and very attentive even offering advice on what drinks to order. What I really loved about this place was the complimentary nacho basket with the red sauce (not even sure what it was - maybe pico de gallo? Doesn\\'t even matter - it tasted good!). As for the food/drink I ordered the Margarita Tacos with the Happy Birthday Margarita. The soft tacos were delicious accompanied by the spicy green sauce + black beans and rice - overall I devoured the whole thing in seconds!

If you are not a fan of Mexican food (if that's even possible), then you must at least come for the margaritas. They have unique flavors from Kiwi to Passionfruit to Pineapple.

The food was great. Me and my friend shared the fajitas. I forgot what it was called but the shrimp, chicken and steak were seasoned so right. The vegetables were even delicious. The margaritas were good. I got the happy birthday margarita. It was soooo good. Get it even though its not your birthday. My friend had the frozen margarita and that was good too. They give you free chips and salsa. The chips were good too. The prices are decent but not too expensive. I would definitely go again.'), (246, 'My wife and I had date night and this place, and it really wasn\\'t anything special. The food was simply, \"meh\", but the drinks were okay.

The fact that we were seated by a really loud an obnoxious guy isn\\'t really the hostess\\' fault, but that certainly did not add to the experience. '), (247, 'Excellent food and Service!

Great happy hour special on margaritas- $6 for frozen, $7 for on the rocks. Delicious and flavorful food. Wonderful ambience. When I went on a Friday night they also had live music. Waiters were extremely friendly. I didn't order any food but tried the chicken quesadillas and chicken nachos. Both superb. Also it was great that they kept the chips and salsa coming all night. Definitely fresh made in the back- both the chips and salsa. You have to try this place if you're around!\"), (250, 'This is a fine place, but is more like a hoaky Suburban restaurant in theory than a cool, NYC establishment.
