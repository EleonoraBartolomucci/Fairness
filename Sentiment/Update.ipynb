I received great service and noticed how attentive my waitresses were. <br><br>When I sat down I was given a biscuit that was SO GOOD. It comes with a berry spread that truly was the cherry on top. It was so delicious I had to ask for another one!!! <br><br>I ordered the fried chicken with white meat and a side of Mac n cheese. Everything was good but not blow my mind good. If I came back, I would probably order something else as the fried chicken wasn&#39;t very flavorful and was kind of dry. I expected a little more out of the fried chicken but overall had a positive experience!\"\n",

This is one of those places, that reviews are deceiving. <br><br>Pros: <br>-The service was great; they&#39;re constantly asking if you need something, no matter who it is. <br>-The drinks were amazing; the blueberry mojito, the mimosa and the tupelo margarita were all yummy and worth it<br>-The warm biscuits were really great; better than expected, especially with jam!<br>-The fried green tomatoes with grits was so good--probably their best dishes. <br><br>Cons:<br>-I was recommended their &#34;famous&#34; chicken so I ordered the Honey Dusted Chicken with their potato cracklin and mac and cheese--I don&#39;t understand why their chicken was well known, it didn&#39;t taste seasoned. This is even although it was battered. Maybe it was the day I came, but it truly wasnt worth it. The Potato Cracklin is something they recommended too, and again, not seasoned and it was not appetizing. I could&#39;ve made this dish and it probably would&#39;ve been best. <br><br>-The Tomato soup was good in taste but we got it cold. We asked for it to be reheated and it still wasn&#39;t warm enough. <br><br>Overall, this place was just okay. I don&#39;t think it deserves the high reviews it has.\"\n",

So, every time I see one near me, I make a point to go because I know the food is going to be amazing. <br><br>I ordered the &#34;Shoo Mercy Griddle&#34; which came with sweet potato pancakes, buttermilk fried chicken, and eggs. There was so much food I had to bring half of it home. <br><br>I highly recommend reservations, especially if you&#39;re trying to go as a larger group.

And the fried cauliflower taco is where it&#39;s at! And six dollar wine on a happy hour. The ambience is great. It wasn&#39;t busy at the time. But I can see where it can pick up. The service is very good. However, when I asked for my tab, I was not charged to happy hour prices. So I had to ask the bartender to get the manager to correct that. And she did.<br>Will return.

This place is quite large and always busy. Weather permitting - wait outside or you will undoubtedly be in the way! <br><br>The food - nice selection of items on their menu and plenty to choose from. If you&#39;re looking for sweet or savory, I&#39;m sure you can find it here. I&#39;ve had both - and genuinely, not impressed. <br><br>Service  - hit or miss as well!

This is my second time at their Charlotte, NC location and once again, I decided to go with their Classic Benny. If you&#39;re anything like me then you love a nice runny egg with well seasoned potatoes. I&#39;m not going to lie though, my aunt got the chicken and biscuits and I kind of wished I would&#39;ve ordered that instead. Not because the Benny wasn&#39;t tasty, but because I feel like you have to have fried chicken at least once when you&#39;re down South. Next time I find myself in Charlotte, I will definitely be giving it a try. Lastly, I had their Apple-Achian mimosa and loved it. I&#39;m not a fan of mixed drinks, but this Apple cider cinnamon mimosa was good enough to order a second. Definitely recommend! <br><br>I want to give a shout out to our waiter, Javaris, who was very hospitable and had us laughing every time he came to check up on us. Very sweet guy!\"\n",

            "8EVCarfyVLP14hlS4HVk1w,\"I had brunch with friends here on a Saturday morning.  We had reservations and they sat us quickly upon arrival.  We were forgotten for 25 minutes until we kindly asked for service.  While they were busy, everyone around us had received service.  Being my first time at this location, this gave me time to peruse the menu.  I ordered/enjoyed the Apple-achain Mimosa (apple cider with cinnamon and booze).  I ordered the Classic Griddle French Toast and added a side of bacon.  The food was absolutely nothing to write home about.  I left here thinking this place is one of the most over-hyped places in all of SouthEnd.  I felt the prices were over inflated for the food and beverage that I ordered. <br>Parking here can be a beast, so its best to Uber/Lyft or ride the light rail here.\"\n",

The girls got the Bloody Mary which was actually pretty spicy and tasty.<br><br>I had an appetite so I got the Carolina Hanger steak with a sunny side up egg.

            "4m9NXICYBC5i9t4aTt-I6w,\"I stopped by here a couple of Saturdays ago with my wife and both of our parents for dinner.  We decided on Tupelo honey because we were able to get last minute reservations for our party of 6 and I personally am a sucker for southern food.  Tupelo Honey is located on the second floor of a strip mall and has both steps and an elevator to get up there.  They had some outdoor seating but on the night that we were there it was pretty chilly and so we ended up sitting inside.  The dining room where we ended up had a ton of seating and a nice rustic look to it.  It had exposed beams and wooden boards on the ceiling and then the wall with the windows was made of brick.  The most interesting feature though had to be the fans in this room which all interconnected with belts and were driven by a single motor.<br><br>For dinner on the evening I decided to go with the buttermilk fried chicken.  The menu described it as boneless and skinless &#34;forever free&#34; chicken breast with milk gravy and it came with two sides for which I chose the Brussels sprouts and green beans.  Before our meals came out we were given some biscuits along with butter and some preserves which my wife really enjoyed.  Whenever our meals came out I was sad to see that my chicken was smothered with the milk gravy.  I guess I should have realized that and ordered it on the side but the thought didn&#39;t cross my mind.  In any case, it didn&#39;t affect the chicken at all which was cooked nicely and had a great crispy breading to it.  The sides were both good as well and I was happy to have two types of greens, even if they weren&#39;t prepared in a particularly healthy way.<br><br>The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  I thought that my meal was good and would be interested in trying some other versions of the fried chicken.\"\n",

            "mCrhj_CG3_pOmDFcfKotRQ,\"After my review from my last visit here, the Manager was courteous enough to send me a note of apology, with a generous offer to return.<br><br>So we made good on the offer tonight...<br><br>My husband and I arrived around 6:30 pm in the middle of pouring rain...and as expected, we were able to slide right into our table. However! Despite many empty tables in the restaurant, the hostess took us to the worst possible seating, in a near-ridiculous, mini-sized table in this hallway area (?!?). Well, I asked for a larger table. She then took us to THE BAR. This pretty much ruined our dining experience from the get-go. No, we didn&#39;t have a reservation, but it was a rainy night, and didn&#39;t think it was necessary...and by all appearances, it didn&#39;t seem necessary at all. We even noticed several empty tables in the restaurant while we were finishing off our meal (?!?!?).<br><br>We started with Mac &amp; Cheese Bites...which were really, really good. No problems there! Then the complimentary Biscuits...which were surprisingly lackluster. I remember them being pretty good last time, but not so much this time. <br><br>As for the entree, my husband ordered the Roasted Mountain Trout, and he really liked it! Despite my husband&#39;s warning (that I probably won&#39;t like it), I ordered the Shoo Mercy Sweet Potato Pancakes. Guess I wanted to order something truly Southern since that&#39;s what this place is all about?!? Well, unfortunately, my husband was right. It was just not my thing. First of all, the plate itself was very generous, with heaping portions of pancakes, bacon, eggs with fried chicken. HUGE!! Sadly, I didn&#39;t like any of it. The chicken itself was way too greasy, and fairly bland. Just not my kind of batter...and just not my kind of flavoring? I can go through the rest, but I think I&#39;ll just stop short and say that I just didn&#39;t love it. <br><br>Thankfully, we ended our meal on a bright note. We ordered these Mini-Mason Jar Desserts, one in Banana Pudding and the other in Peanut Butter-Chocolate Ganache. I&#39;m happy to say that these little treats were DEE-Lish! <br><br>One thing I must mention is the Iced Tea. It wasn&#39;t even cold...as there was no ice in the first or the refilled cup. I had to actually stop myself from bitching about this part with the waitress. After all, I was here to make good on a generous offer!<br><br>As for the service... Again, a bit mixed. I can tell that the waitress was a bit stressed with the amount of tables she was assigned to in the bar area, but she did her best. Even the Manager kindly stopped by our table for a greeting. But I can&#39;t ignore the fact that we were rudely seated by the hostess not just once (at this awful hallway area with a mini-sized table), but a second time, ending up at the bar area. I stopped myself from mentioning this bit of aggravation to the Manager when he stopped by the table as well. But seriously, if the restaurant was full, I would have understood...but it was not (possibly due the dreary, rainy weather).<br><br>Honestly, despite the ups and downs in the foods, I would have gladly given a 4 star rating this time IF we were seated in the restaurant itself. After all, this was a visit based on a courtesy offer...and we appreciated the good gesture by the Manager. Again, I did like the appetizer and the dessert, but was just not a fan of the super-Southern, super-fatty entree. Plus, I hated the NON-icy Iced Tea. Luckily, my husband liked all the foods, the app, the entree and the dessert. But I&#39;ll say it again for the last time... We had dinner at THE BAR (when there were plenty of tables open at the restaurant!). Both my husband and I didn&#39;t appreciate that at all...and for that alone, I just can&#39;t up the review from my last visit. Sorry...but not sorry?\"\n",

Finally made it here tonight and it did not disappoint!<br><br>It&#39;s Southern food done well. They are named after a particular kind of honey from FL, which they also serve with their biscuits - it was amazing. They also served the biscuit with a homemade blueberry jam - also very tasty! I did not love the biscuit itself - it was more crusty type than fluffy and I prefer fluffy, but it did have good flavor.<br><br>I came here a favorite of mine - shrimp n grits and they offer 2 variations! SCORE! I ordered the tupelo honey kind and loved it. The grits were fluffy and cheesy and slid right down my throat. The shrimp were cooked perfect and the bread on the side was a bonus. <br><br>I had to try a mini dessert and it didn&#39;t disappoint. I ordered the peanut butter mouse with chocolate ganache and a dab of whipped cream. It was sweet and delicious.<br><br>The service here was phenomenal! Emily was my server and she was patient and knowledgeable on the menu. I ask a lot of questions and she rolled right with it and gave me opinions and told me about top sellers. She was quick and efficient and when I asked for butter with my biscuit she even warmed it a bit as it was fresh out of the fridge and hard. Above and beyond!\"\n",

I will say the prices are a bit high, however everything was very good. We got a side of fried okra which is cooked perfectly and getting a side order of eggs gives you a very generous portion! <br>Our waiter was very friendly and quick to serve us and take our order.

I got here close to closing time on a weekday so there was no wait.<br><br>I ordered the famous honey dusted bone in fried chicken and honey jalapeno lacquer roasted chicken with okra, brussel sprouts and yukon mashed potatoes. I guess when you&#39;re at a restaurant name Tupelo HONEY, better order something with honey in it! After ordering I was provided a biscuit with jam, which turned out to be so good I request another biscuit when the chicken arrived so I could make my very own Chicken Biscuit! The honey dusted fried chicken was very peculiar at first as I had never had chicken with honey, but after a while my taste buds acclimated to it and it turned out pretty decent. The fried okra and brussel sprouts was spot on comfort food and the yukon potatoes were normal.<br><br>Overall I would say the food was great and the decor was nice.

This is way way way sweet! Powerful taste but I think I needed a dentist after just a sip. I think a bit of soda water in it to tone it down might have helped.

I&#39;m glad they didn&#39;t bring out more or I would have gorged myself on just these.<br><br>For my main lunch I had the BBQ chicken press: smoked jalapeño bbq sauce, sliced apples, white cheddar cheese, garlic buttermilk ranch on a grilled flatbread... and it was Oooohhh My Goddie Toooooo Hottie delicious!! I even got it with a side of pinto beans that were not too bad...(I don&#39;t normally like pinto beans but these are good) trying to branch out.<br><br>Our waiter was excellent... very friendly and attentive.

I got the fried chicken white meat with a side of the grits and a side salad (to be healthy) the chicken was fried to perfection the salad was full of fresh greens, and the white balsamic vinegar dressing was to die for.<br><br>Pros:<br>Nice spot (almost said cute)<br>Foods great <br>Staff were very nice <br><br>Cons:<br>VERY LOUD<br><br>Give the star rating on <br><br>Food appearance:5<br>Food taste:5<br>Food price:5<br>Kid-friendly:5<br>Vegan or other things on the menu:3<br>Service:5<br><br>Give recommendations for Improvement: So there is a reason I couldn&#39;t give this place a 5 star and im torn about it.

If you don&#39;t mind hearing the firefighters get called nad moving out to do what they do best and respond in a moment&#39;s, notice then its five stars.

Both were also so heavy we couldn&#39;t finish either even tho we were sharing. Tho I will blame some of that on the basket of hot pillowy biscuits that preceded the meal that were irresistible. <br>Also we got two Margs nothing extra ordinary but tasty none the less seeing as how both were polished off. <br>I can def see why everyone talks about this place.

            "z4Bvefqd1bV7hwAuM7LJbw,\"On a trip to Charlotte, I was looking for a dinner spot on a Friday night. I checked out the most reviewed restaurants in town on Yelp, and Tupelo Honey was at the top of the list. I stopped by with a friend and we got a table on the patio. Tupelo is located in a trendy shopping center with several other bars, restaurants, and a tattoo parlor. They do have a parking lot but finding a spot can become tricky at peak hours. I found one of the last spots as someone was leaving right when I pulled up. <br><br>Tupelo has an awesome craft cocktails menu even though they&#39;re pretty pricey. I went with their version of the mojito. From there, they start you off with some delicious biscuits and jam. I always appreciate a complimentary starter!<br><br>Appalachian pork with two sides (4.5/5): the pork loin came with a tangy BBQ sauce and your choice of two sides. I went with the cheese grits and tomato basil soup. While the soup was really good, they barely give you any of it. It was served in more of a platter than a bowl which was bizarre. Especially since the serving sizes of their other sides like their grits and fries are generous. The cheese grits were great and complimented my Southern dish well. <br><br>Service was also awesome throughout. Tupelo Honey has a great ambiance whether you&#39;re outside on the patio, inside, or at the bar.\"\n",

Open kitchen plan too, so that&#39;s welcomed. <br><br>Our waitress, Sapphira, was really helpful and knowledgeable with the menu giving suggestions since my husband hadn&#39;t been to this location. <br><br>We had the Pimento Cheese Dip with carrots and cauliflower as she went out of her way to ask Chef if they could substitute chips. It was amazing! <br><br>For entrees, I had the smoked jalapeño ribs with collards (bacon) and S/P Brussels sprouts. I was SO full after the pimento cheese dip, I only ate two of my half rack ribs. Juicy, flavorful, and call of the bone, they come soaked in their smoked Jalepeno BBQ sauce. Slightly sweet, spicy flavor. Collards were done very well and didn&#39;t have that over seasoned flavor. <br><br>While waiting for our entrees, she brought 2 biscuits and their blackberry compote. My husbands mouth dropped ...he hasn&#39;t had a moist biscuit like that in a long time!!!!<br><br>My husband had the Chimichurri roasted chicken (dark meat) and it fell off the bone! Super juicy, topped with arugula and green beans. He had the goat cheese stone ground grits and Mac n cheese. Just like home. Grits were creamy and Mac n cheese has the baked barely burnt cheese on top. <br><br>As we were finishing up, Sapphira mentioned banana pudding for dessert, so we took one to go. We sat and talked with her for a while (it was our anniversary) so we told her the story of how we met/and our wedding. When she brought the Check and banana pudding to go, she surprised us with a Tupelo Honey Coolbook and some of their blueberry compote! Super sweet gesture that made our night!!!\"\n",

Of the entrees, so far the hanger steak is my favorite--mine have been perfectly cooked, with the most delicious green beans. It&#39;s just the right amount of food so that I leave satisfied but not uncomfortably stuffed. I also enjoy the Appalachian pork. The spicy sriracha sauce it comes with isn&#39;t that spicy and adds a the honey adds a nice sweetness to the pork. (I recommend getting the sprouts for your side--they pair very well with the sriracha sauce, too.)<br><br>From the bar, I recommend the wildflower moscow mule (VERY refreshing, especially on a hot night out on the deck) and the lavender and honeysuckle lemondrop. One of these days, I&#39;ll have to stop by for breakfast and a bloody mary from their list. <br><br>I enjoy sitting outside, and sometimes wonder if that&#39;s why I&#39;ve had trouble with service -- maybe the servers also have tables indoors they&#39;re juggling? Or maybe, since I&#39;m usually a party of one, I&#39;m just overlooked. But if they could get their service issues figured out, I would come here more often.\"\n",

We were sat pretty close to the time we arrived which was great because it was PACKED. <br><br>Tupelo is really pretty inside, I love the southern vibes. There are small details that really add to the atmosphere - the logo on the napkins and the dishware, I loved the feel of it all.<br><br>Service was really slow, we sat down at noon and didn&#39;t receive our food until well after 1:00pm. Our waitress was apologetic, but it definitely put a damper on the experience. She seemed to have too many tables so while the food was held up in the kitchen, we also sat there with empty coffee cups and water glasses. I think if she had been able to leave a carafe of water bring over more biscuits it would have helped us from getting antsy. <br><br>The biscuits are fantastic, served with honey and jam they really make the experience better. I love the presentation and that they are served warm. These are included at no extra charge. <br><br>Now, the brunch. We each ordered something different - the Old Skool Breakfast Bowl received the most praise. The sweet potato pancakes were tasty, but they were thin and the presentation was sloppy. Same with the breakfast combo, everything was plated in a rush due to the wait I&#39;m assuming.<br><br>I had the classic eggs Benedict and it was OK. The eggs were not cooked well, the white was still runny and pretty unappealing. I didn&#39;t eat much of the egg due to that - the hollandaise was bitter and thin, again, not very appealing. The potatoes were listed as &#34;parmesan &amp; rosemary&#34; but as you can see from the picture...they were just unseasoned potatoes. Overall, not very impressive - especially after waiting over an hour.\"\n",

My mom ordered a burger with a side of chicken chili and a bottle of wine for us to share. The chicken sandwich was the worst chicken sandwich I&#39;ve ever had. I would&#39;ve been better off going to chick Fil a. It had no seasoning what so over. I had to drown it in honey hot sauce just to get threw my meal. My moms chicken chili had no chicken in it. It was just a bowl of chili sauce and cheese. Our waitress took it back for a replacement only to return saying the chef blended it up so you couldn&#39;t see the actual chicken. Lol.

When was the last time you made toast for a meal and just had one slice of toast!? Never. So upon ordering I asked our server how many slices of toast because obviously I was looking for more than just the one slice, I was told it was one but assured it was a long slice. Fair enough I thought it could work. So imagine my disappointment when the avocado toast arrives and there is a mountain of avocado on the smallest piece of toast you have ever seen.

There is no pride in the food that they serve or the service that they provide. Our experience with Tupelo Honey was just that- a disappointment. <br><br>I made reservations for lunch to celebrate a special birthday before heading to the airport for my flight. The parking situation is an absolute nightmare which started the sour taste in my mouth. We then checked in for our reservation and had a very confusing interaction with the hostess who seemed to imply that they were doing us a favor by honoring our reservation. The restaurant honestly wasn&#39;t completely full (despite there being many folks waiting for tables) and isn&#39;t the the point of reservation? I digress...<br><br>Our meal was anything but worthy of a revisit. I had a chicken avocado sandwich- the chicken was over-fried and dried out. The avocado had a nice flavor but couldn&#39;t undo the overall &#34;Meh&#34; of the chicken. My date&#39;s chicken and biscuits felt as though you were eating the desert with how dry it all was. The egg that he added was overdone too. The complementary biscuits were fine. The blueberry compote tasted artificial and resembled a blueberry pop tart. The Bloody Mary was average- not the award winning greatness that they advertise. Also, my Diet Coke was never refilled and was $3!!!! What a sham. <br><br>Our waitress was pleasant enough but barely checked on us. The menus were wet and filthy. Their bathroom is one that I hope to never step foot in again.

Honestly, it a great aqutromon to any meal. I being the southern belle I pretend to be grabbed the Peach Mimosa which was absolutely fabulous. Its 16 ounces of sweet nectar. The chicken dip has a kick and is served with house made kettle chips and chopped pickles. We decided on the same meal. Our server brought us a large plate with a chicken fillet fried to a golden brown layered atop a southern buttery moist biscuit drenched in a ham based gravy; ma&#39;am.... MA&#39;AM.

I went all in - i had the fried green tomatoes, pimento cheese and the Shoo Mercy breakfast. All the dishes were creative and well executed but I feel it lacked the flavor profile I was expecting. It was really good but I had some heightened expectations. It&#39;s also odd that the best part of the meal was the complimentary biscuit with homemade jam.<br><br>I will say the restaurant has such a homey environment and our server Matt was awesome!\"\n",

The place wasn&#39;t crowded but it got busy about 6PM.  I enjoyed my meal which was a basic smoked salmon Caesar salad.  The fried chicken looked really good even though I didn&#39;t have any but everyone seemed very satisfied.  I&#39;m only giving a 3 star rating because this was my first experience.  I hope to come back soon to enjoy one of them Frozay&#39;s!  I would recommend this place for sure!\n",

Squeeze the lemon for a better taste. There was nothing special about the Brussels sprouts... added honey and even pulled out the lemon pepper from my bag to season it.. still nothing. I ordered an appetizer and never got it, which wasn&#39;t a big deal, I told her if they hadn&#39;t started it, not to. The entree looked like enough food. I&#39;m not going to hate on the waitress because I&#39;ve been in her shoes but I do feel like she could have been a little more personable and friendly. <br><br>I&#39;m not sure what course is better, but I&#39;m going to say brunch isn&#39;t their strong point...?

The seating and interior was much better and spacious. I got the &#39;Old Skool&#39; Breakfast Bowl. It was basically grits with beans, pieces of bacon and sausage, and two eggs on top. I asked for no cheese because I&#39;m lactose intolerant. After the meal, I WAS SO SO FULL. It was so good. On top of that, they give you complimentary biscuits with REAL jelly. It was great!

            "4Uf5wFLKUzvhhXA3SEtViA,\"I came here five or so years ago with friends for lunch because we had heard good things about it and were curious to try it. I knew there was a reason I hadn&#39;t come back since then. I came for a brunch here recently and Tupelo again proved why I don&#39;t come here often. It&#39;s overpriced and just..not that good. We had the brunch reservation for at least a week but were made to wait at least 15 minutes even though we could see our empty table. We were served decently tasty biscuits and jam while we waited for our food, and we each ordered a mimosa to start. Our server was very nice and funny, although he mixed up the mimosa order quite badly causing two of us to get our mimosas when everyone else was halfway done with theirs. The apple cider mimosas are an interesting flavor, but I recommend just going with the classic. For food, I got the classic shrimp and goat cheese grits with sweet bell peppers, scallions, bread, and grilled lemon. The shoo mercy grits with chorizo, spinach, and egg sounded better but were unbelievably expensive, and even the plainer order I got was still very unreasonably priced for the amount and quality (there&#39;s a reason their website brunch menu doesn&#39;t have the prices listed). The other problem was that while our server was pretty great, the attendants cleaning tables and the second hostess kept glaring at us while we ate and hung out. We understand that Tupelo Honey is popular and that Sunday brunches are a hot commodity in Charlotte, especially Southend, but it&#39;s really not like we were loitering and we felt like we were being rushed out of the restaurant. Not coming back unless someone insists.\"\n",

They&#39;ll simply just put them on a separate plate, and hand them to the person(s) who accompanied you. So for this lack of a sub option, that star 5th star wasn&#39;t attained.<br><br>The food is amazing! They have these sweet potato pancakes (pricey at $19) that are a MUST HAVE to all pancake lovers. And the fried green tomatoes over goat cheese grits were an extremely pleasant surprise! I almost missed the opportunity to take a pic for you fine peeps. Whew...

He was really sweet and his coworkers pitched in to help once we got seated and rolling. I was thrilled with my food choice, the fried chicken was spiced well and moist, and the gravy was peppery and delicious, the biscuits were obviously handmade and absolutely amazing.

The perks of this location is that it is right next to the light rail and is located in South End. This spot is on the top floor and they have free parking. <br><br>I ate at the bar with my friend and we both ordered the pick 4 combo.  When the server gave us our food, we realized that we were not given utensils. There weren&#39;t any bartenders behind the bar, so we had to look around to find someone to give us silverware so we could eat. This took about a few minutes. As the random server gave us our utensils, I asked him for ketchup since our bartenders were still not present. I was first given one that barely had ketchup, then  when our bartenders finally arrived back, I asked them for a new one. Just for me to get a new one took quite some time. Kinda sucked since I prefer to eat my eggs and potatoes with ketchup. Also, my friend&#39;s bacon was under cooked, so she had to request for more bacon. <br><br>The experience was not the best, but I enjoyed my mimosa and the decor was cool.\"\n",

The sauce took away from everything. The bread was super hard to even remotely cut into. I gave up cutting up my bread and ate the avocado drenched in the nasty sauce. The avocado toast was served with a wilted salad not fresh at all.<br><br>Southern hospitality mimosas had a hint of nectar flavor but the mimosas was flat no oomph where did the pinapple flavor go? <br><br>My party did not enjoy there meals as well. The omelet had bacon which was not crispy instead it was just fatty and soggy.<br><br> The chicken sandwich was mediocre. Apparently the breading ratio was more breading then chicken.  They also did tenderize the chicken which causes to cook unevenly.<br><br>I ordered a side of sage sausage. The sausage was not edible. The texture was very mushy and the taste was so horrible I can&#39;t describe it baby food taste better then the sage sausage. Right in my napkin it goes.<br><br>Please save your money and time go elsewhere. We were fortunate I was a yelp user we got a little bit off. 10% better then nothing. <br><br>Our server name Morgan was extremely impersonal and rude. I mean seriously who as a server rolles there eyes at the customers? We got major eye roll when we asked him for a third cup for the free pint giveaway. Our party of three all signed up to receive a free pint glass. Not only did he roll his eyes he slammed the cup onto our table. <br><br>The seating was infront of a running food door. Everytime a server needed to run a food for the people on the patio we got a blast of hot air slammed in our faces.

            "o4iHwVDRfhMMlHF6IlzrJQ,\"We got food to go which I am generally skeptical about. I got the pork grilled cheese sandwich. It was the perfect balance between sweet and savory- mostly savory with a slight hint of sweet. The bread could have been crispier but that could also be due to the fact that we got it to go. The potatoes au gratin were just okay. More creamy than cheesy in my opinion. My grandmother got the shrimp and grits and said it was okay. (She had a French restaurant once rated in the top 3 restaurants in NC so she is quite critical). She gave it 3 and I gave it a 4. I think if we had eaten there it would have earned a 4. I&#39;ll definitely be going back!<br><br>I went back with my parents and was very impressed. We came for brunch around 11:30 and there was a wait for over an hour. We ended up eating at the bar and I was very impressed. My past experiences eating at a bar have required fighting for the attention of the bar tender. Lauren was incredible, she regularly checked in on us regularly and even had a nice conversation or two with us. <br><br>The food was amazing. To start, they give you biscuits (free)which were very tasty. I topically find biscuits to be dry and bland but these were slightly salty, and moist. I got the sweet potato pancakes for my main course which were really good. The fried chicken was nothing special though but I love some good sweet potato pancakes. <br><br>My mom got the mountain harvest bowl. She said it was a perfect combination of flavors. She said she would definitely get it again.<br><br>My dad got the pulled pork grilled cheese sandwich which is my favorite dish. The French fried he got with it were slightly soft which is exactly how I like them. But about half of them were in that perfect medium between soft and crunchy. He thought the sandwich was a creative combination on pumpernickel bread that was very good.<br><br>I recommend making a reservation if you plan to eat here.\"\n",

I have dined here fairly often over the past few years, although this was the first time I&#39;ve been there for brunch; it won&#39;t be the last. The Southwestern Omelet is THE BEST omelet I have EVER eaten, omletes are my &#34;go to&#34; for breakfast. BTW: It is served with potato cracklings, but since I am keto so told the server to hold them. She graciously offered several options, and the sliced tomatoes fit the bill perfectly.  <br><br>My sister built her breakfast of scrambled eggs, pancakes and bacon from the Breakfast Combo menu. Although her bacon was a little less-done than she prefers, Alicia promptly had it replaced and cooked to perfection. Sis said everything was delicious.

However, this place is walking distance from my home so we gave it another shot. We won&#39;t go back. <br><br>We waited 20 minutes for a table despite that fact that there were countless open tables. When we inquired about the many open tables, they told us it was a kitchen/service issue rather than a space issue. <br><br>We were seated indoors by the bar. It was freezing, and we immediately inquired as to why it was so cold. The server told us they had to keep the temp super low to avoid a humidity issue in the bar area. Umm what? <br><br>We had a server in training and a tenured server assisting. This was annoying as the individual in training would ask if we wants apps of cocktails and we&#39;d say no all while the tenured server observed from behind. Then the tenured server would coach the newbie in front of us &#34;did you ask about apps, what about offering a mimosa.&#34; We felt this should not have been handled in front of us.<br><br>When the AC issue became unbearable we asked to move. They finally found a spot for us in the main dining area and we were shocked to find it colder so we moved back to the bar area. My father-in-law was ready to leave (food hadn&#39;t even arrived yet), and then the tenured server informed us the kitchen was very backed up. <br><br>Our food finally came and it was good. We expected an apology for the extreme AC issues, but received none. And we weren&#39;t the only ones who found it could - we saw numerous people go to their cars for blankets or coats and others asked to be moved outside. The restaurant needs to fix the AC problem ASAP. <br><br>Overall, I&#39;ve had 2 poor experiences here for 2 totally different reasons.

As many off days as on days?  I really was so excited to eat here and fall in love with the food - so many positive 5 star reviews can&#39;t be wrong, right?  Even within my own dining experience, there were some very high highlights and some very low lowlights.  <br>First the good - our server was awesome. Jasmine was patient and helpful.  The Mac and cheese balls were a fav.  The fried green tomatoes were good but def need salt and flavor on the actual tomato - the grits underneath were great, however 4 thin slices of tomato is hardly a hearty app portion.  We also had the fried chicken on the bone, bleu buffalo flavor, and that was decent. <br>The not so good - although the fried chicken was decent, I expected more than two small measly pieces. the chicken was pre sauced which made the otherwise crispy skin super soggy.  <br>The incredibly disappointing- the sweet and spicy fried chicken sandwich, the flavor was decent but the chicken was sooooo dry it was like sawdust.   And it was thin thin.   As if it was pre-fried that morning then refried - not made to order.  The burger was a hockey puck and flavorless. Nothing special whatsoever.  Lastly the pancakes, not light and fluffy as you might think, but slightly thicker then a crepe and also pre-sauced so mushy once they hit the table.  The tomato soup had an ok flavor but separated quickly after a few mins.  I really wanted to love it all.  Maybe I&#39;ll give it another shot if in the area, but wouldn&#39;t make a special trip.  Sorry Tupelo!\"\n",

Not sure what&#39;s up with this location but I would absolutely not recommend. I ordered takeout from here. I have always love the Brussels sprouts appetizer that they have so I ordered those. What I got was just Brussels spouts. They&#39;re supposed to be cooked with lemon and bacon and served with ranch. None of those ingredients were present. Just a pile of REALLY REALLY greasy Brussels sprouts. I also ordered their pecan pie for desert. You could tell they were just clearing out the kitchen and filling to go orders with whatever garbage was left in the kitchen. The pie was literally just a mixed up heap...like they scraped the bottoms of a bunch of pie pans and gave me what they could put together. As soon as I got my order I called the restaurant. It was a few minutes before closing but by no means after so you&#39;d think someone would answer. Nope. I chose the option to leave a voicemail for management. I left a message explaining my order wasn&#39;t correct and requested a call back. Weeks later and still no word. This is how this restaurant chooses to treat customers and address issues. With delivery fees this meal came to $45 and went straight in the trash. Not one part of it was salvageable. It&#39;s shocking that a Tupelo Honey location would consider this kind of food good enough to serve. 45 minutes later and another $40, I ordered yet another dinner from somewhere else. Thanks for nothing Tupelo Honey Charlotte. You&#39;re swell. There are better restaurants in the area. Go there. Don&#39;t waste your time on a chain restaurant, the worst one of them all being here, to receive mediocre food from a staff that clearly doesn&#39;t care.\"\n",

If you&#39;ve ever had Popeye&#39;s, Chick-fil-A, or KFC, you will be disappointed by the fried chicken. First off the restaurant is freezing for no apparent reason, even the hostesses were wearing their down parkas inside. The biscuits are rubbery, undercooked, and don&#39;t even resemble a good flaky biscuit. We got the &#34;famous fried chicken&#34; which was underseasoned, not well fried, and not crispy. The southern BLT chicken sandwich was even worse, so dry it was hard to chew and absolutely no flavor. The pimento cheese and fried pickle burger was equally bad, rubbery and hard to swallow without any sauce. They even managed to screw up fries. Really?! How much really goes into fries that you can screw them up so bad?! Somehow despite going at 11am they were also &#34;out&#34; of all sorts of normal things like chicken salad, chicken dip, banana pudding, etc. I have no idea how this place ever managed to become a chain.

I couldn&#39;t even finish my fries (!!!). <br><br>All in all, a beautiful &amp; delicious lunch spot!\"\n",

They were cooked and seasoned perfectly and came with an amazing dipping sauce. <br><br>The pork sandwich in Rye that I had was very tasty.

            "0EgbVtQfdNQq3Tapxwl_sw,\"Wow. So disappointed in Tupelo Honey.<br><br>Our party of four went for brunch on Memorial Day. We made a reservation for 11:30 and after a short wait, we were seated. On our way past the host stand we overheard a group being told they could expect to wait an hour for a table. <br><br>We ordered drinks -- four waters, two coffees, and three mimosas. Water and coffee came out within a few minutes, but the mimosas dragged behind. We ordered deviled eggs to start, and a plate of biscuits and jam followed. We sat at an empty table for half an hour before our entrees were delivered -- over an hour after we were seated. My breakfast sandwich arrived with about half of the ingredients listed on the menu, with cold, unmelted cheese, and with soggy bread. My fries were pale and cold. At this point, we were so behind schedule that it hardly seemed worth getting my entree corrected -- and at what cost? Another 40 minute wait?<br><br>Our server stopped by halfway through our entrees and asked if we&#39;d like another round of mimosas. They weren&#39;t delivered until after the check came, twenty minutes later. All told, our brunch stretched on for over two hours and I left hungry.<br><br>After past pleasant visits here, I wanted to believe that it was just a rough service, but after reading several recent Yelp reviews, it appears that our experience falls in line with a recent trend. Tupelo Honey isn&#39;t a new restaurant -- what&#39;s up with the pacing? No wonder people have to wait for a table if it takes over an hour to get eggs on the plate.<br><br>It was unpleasant enough, but it became embarrassing, as we were hosting friends from out of town, trying to let Charlotte show off as a fantastic city, and this was their last meal before hitting the road. I can&#39;t imagine we&#39;ll be back.\"\n",

It was really dry and nothing special at all. Grits were a watery puddle. Green beans were OK.<br>I should say I had very high expectations from previous visits and though I still love the concept and the decor, it kinda felt like the whole place could use a good scrubbing, starting with the grime around the door entrance handles. Floor felt sticky. There was trash around the downstairs elevator entrance (my mom uses a wheelchair).

We went on Friday night around 6:30-7:00pm, and the restaurant wasn&#39;t crowded at all. That was our first clue. <br>The food we ordered was just okay. The brussel sprouts and hominy was ruined by the overpowering horseradish taste, the macaroni and cheese was very dry, and the biscuits weren&#39;t warm.

We found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. Prior to going, my sister called ahead for seating and they said they could not accommodate our party of 5. We were surprised by this but decided to try to go to the restaurant anyway because it did not sound busy. We were correct and when we arrived, there were not more than five tables sat. An employee greeted us and walked us to a table immediately. We had dinner and the food was fine. It was not the best meal I had in Charlotte but it was enjoyable. <br><br>I got home and realized I had left my designer sunglasses at the restaurant. I had to wait until the next morning to call because the restaurant had already closed. I was off to a flight back home the next morning so I called the restaurant from the airport so that my friend who lives in Charlotte could pick up the glasses. Luckily, the man who answered the phone told me they had my sunglasses. I was so relieved as these glasses were expensive!  My friend told me she would not be able to make it until the following day because she was celebrating the Memorial Day Holiday. I called the restaurant to let them know when my friend would be arriving, as well as her name. The employee who answered the phone stated that they would put a note on the sunglasses and put them in the manager&#39;s office. I was so happy and appreciative that the staff had my sunglasses.<br><br>Sadly, when my friend went to pick up the sunglasses, they said that they did not have them. I called and told the staff that I was confused that they initially told me they had my glasses and now they don&#39;t. I was connected with the manager who was not helpful. She told me that she had not been working the past few days. When asked if she could reach out to the manager on duty at that time, she told me he resigned yesterday. The conversation ended with the manager telling me she would check with the employees who were working that night. <br><br>Surprise, surprise, it has been days and I still have not heard anything. One of the employees at this restaurant clearly stole my sunglasses. it is such a disgrace that they had my sunglasses and then they just disappeared. I wish I could do more to recover my glasses but since I live in New Jersey, I have been at the mercy of phone calls and emails. So much for southern hospitality!\"\n",

He was mostly prompt but there was some lag after our food was delivered. I ordered the southern shakshuka and everything but the eggs were phenomenal.  They were grossly undercooked and once broken open both the white and yolk were liquid. I was able to successfully scoop them out of the grits. I flagged down another server who took them and I asked him to please have them cook the white but leave the yolk runny. After nearly all of my food was consumed, our waiter brought back to hard cooked eggs. It was disappointing but he was apologetic and quickly replaced them with properly cooked eggs. <br><br>The reasons for my reducing my rating to three stars were the following...<br><br>1) The under cooked eggs and the lack of the quick replacement<br><br>2) The table in the window were not clean at all and there was a spider web that was disturbing<br><br>3) The complimentary biscuits were incredibly salty to the point they were inedible. <br><br>I will definitely give this place another chance as I feel the good outweighs the bad.\"\n",

I made the mistake of taking friends visiting from out of town in June and our experience took over 2+ hours and it was nothing out of this world.  <br><br>And today, I watched other tables who arrived later than us be served well before us.  When my sandwich arrived, the side did not - they told me it was on it&#39;s way.  It never made it but I did see it on the plate of so many others that were being served before us and after us.  Since I had nothing to distract me from the sandwich, I opened it up and saw the smallest chicken breast ever.  It was not even the size of my palm and when I finally got the attention of someone, there was no apology or offer to fix - he just took the plate.  My family ate their meals while I sat there.  My mom ordered a decaf coffee which never arrived either and after 1 hour of being there, we were told it was still brewing.  I had no idea coffee took 1+ hour to brew.  <br><br>I was made to feel as if I was being difficult and they were doing me a favor for not charging me for a meal that did not arrive complete and I did not consume.  I have never been more disappointed in the way I was treated and will not allow this to happen again.  The manager on duty told me they were short on staff yet I saw tons of staff in the kitchen and more than enough servers for the number of tables.  If they did not want to serve me I wish they would have saved me the trouble and told me up front.<br><br>And I have not even mentioned the restrooms which seems to be a reoccurring theme in the reviews when sorted by newest.  Absolutely filthy - dried liquid on the stall doors, overflowing garbage - gives you a good sense of how the rest of the restaurant is cared for in my opinion.\"\n",

The hummus is my favorite so imagine hummus plus ground black eyed peas. I know it sounds weird but it works. The pimiento cheese was a close second and was very creamy and good.  For the grand finale I ordered the salmon with carrots and roasted cauliflower.

One was a brunch that was AMAZING - I love their biscuit starters, and the food I had (Shakshuka over goat cheese grits) was so so good. The second experience was a dinner that was just awful. I came with a group. The place wasn&#39;t even that busy, but when all our food came out, a lot food was just missing, and we had to remind the waiter about it several times. The food was subpar. And the waiter tried to charge us the wrong amount, based on what their own menu said.\"\n",

            "LGWsPj3EACH6Qea_Aq_boQ,\"We went to Tupelo Honey near the South End of Charlotte with some out-of-town guests who were very excited/determined to go. We went for brunch on a Saturday, and some of our group ordered the Bloody Marys that were presented with a lovely strip of candied bacon, some olives and pickled okra. I had a sip, and joined the consensus with a thumbs-up on the tasty tomato mix. <br><br>Our service was excellent. However, I wasn&#39;t as thrilled about the fried chicken as I wanted to be. I try to order something that is a &#39;signature&#39; for a place. The hot sauce on the chick was too hot and &#39;one note&#39; for me and I didn&#39;t enjoy the boring fried coating. In fact, the chicken didn&#39;t have much flavor. Or perhaps my taste buds were already &#39;lasered numb&#39; by the hot sauce. I surveyed the table with order-envy and regretted that I hadn&#39;t gone for the sweet tea flavored fried chick instead. <br><br>Overall, our group was happy with their food, and enjoyed the flavorful Brussels sprouts, biscuits and honey that we shared among us.<br><br>Part of the charm of Tupelo Honey is the 2nd-floor location (old building, wide porch) that sits among the trees. The company could elevate the brand a bit with some attention to things like their menu design and logo. The logo makes no sense and feels so &#34;off&#34; when they have a cool name and vibe to work with...what&#39;s up with not having professional design? Takes it down towards &#34;Lizard&#39;s Thicket&#34; to me.<br><br>It was odd also that someone came by our table and asked how things were without introducing himself. We wondered...who was that, the manager, or just an obnoxious passer-by?<br><br>Overall it was enjoyable. With a little love and attention, Tupelo Honey could warm itself up and get from good to great.\"\n",

We decided to eat somewhere else and reserved a table at 7:00. This time there wasn&#39;t a wait for the table. We sat down and our waitress brought us our beverages, and we waited 30 minutes for her to take our order, and another WHOLE HOUR for our food to arrive. We reminded her multiple times about our food and had the same excuse every time that there was a lot of people and not enough staff. And to that I say, how many hours do you have to wait for your food at 2:00 pm when you already have to wait an hour to be seated? <br>If you wait an hour for food, you would expect it to be exceptional. No, it was average food. It wasn&#39;t bad, it filled me and my family up and had flavor, but the presentation was mediocre and it wasn&#39;t even warm. We had a side of mashed potatoes in two of our plates and had to wait an extra ten minutes for the potatoes because aparrently they ran out? The potatoes weren&#39;t even good! And foods like French fries and mashed potatoes that you would expect to be pretty salty were nowhere near salted enough.<br>Our waitress didn&#39;t seem to care about our distress about the wait for the food, and only at the end did one of the managers come to apologize.<br>I really hate to give this beautiful-looking restaurant a three-star review, and I would&#39;ve done less than three stars but I really think that we just had bad luck and that it is supposed to be a very good restaurant since it was recommended to us so much.\"\n",

            "uRyQHYykmOFL66r8bWzT5g,\"While visiting Charlotte, I was drawn to Tupelo Honey based on local reviews. We arrived near noon on a Sunday and were informed that it would be about a 45 min wait. Completely understandable for the time and day. Fortunately we were welcomed to hang out by the bar and grab drinks while we waited.<br><br>At about the 45 minute mark, we were alerted and seated. The waitress was in training and very welcoming! We placed our orders and about 10 minutes later, our drinks and biscuits arrived. <br><br>The biscuits were fantastic! We enjoyed ours smothered with honey and topped with the provided jam. Really got our tastebuds excited for the meal.<br><br>The food took about 40 minutes to arrive despite the ebbing brunch crowd. Made me wish we got an extra platter of biscuits or such to better manage the wait. When the food arrived, I was excited beyond belief. I had ordered the fried chicken with goat cheese grits. A dish that was acclaimed in various reviews I encountered. I first went for the leg and wing. They weren&#39;t bad! Nice and crispy though the seasoning seemed almost ghostly. Then it was time for the white meat. <br><br>My first bite nearly choked me with the dryness of the meat. It made the metaphor of something tasting like sawdust, very true. It was super disappointing. Fortunately the grits were delicious and the homemade pickles were fresh tasting.<br><br>Honestly this review would have been three stars due to the long wait for food and the inedible nature of the famous fried chicken. That being said, the wait staff was super courteous and comped me for the chicken when I brought it to their attention. Definitely a nice gesture.<br><br>Hopefully it was just an off day because I loved the aesthetic of the restaurant. The wait for food would also have been bearable if the resulting meal blew me away. <br><br>Maybe next time I&#39;m in Charlotte, I&#39;ll give them another try.\"\n",

However, I came for an event after work and had the opportunity to try some more goodies. <br><br>We started with apps and I tried the tried mason jar dips, okra and honey chipotle wings.  Meh. They were fine, nothing really exciting. <br><br>However, I fell in love with the crispy brussels appetizer. The combination of lemon, garlic and bacon and herbs. Then add the side of ranch. Yummy. I could have eaten those all night long. <br><br>For my meal I ordered the Shoo Mercy sweet potato pancakes. It was a lot of food! Three pancakes, bacon, eggs, fried chicken and grilled fruit. The pancakes were just okay. The chicken was pretty typical and the eggs and bacon were both standard. <br><br>I don&#39;t see myself suggesting this place as somewhere I have to visit again.

It also is recommended by many as a go-to brunch place around town. <br>I visited TH with a friend during one of Charlotte&#39;s latest rainy weekends, it was busy but not packed. We made a reservation, arrived at 12:30 ish and waited no more than 10 minutes. <br>The service was kind and friendly from the host stand to the those who came to the table.<br>We ordered mimosas (seemed over priced to me).<br>Biscuits come on the table (they weren&#39;t particularly warm). <br>We ordered an appetizer, the fried green tomatoes. They were a little cold, grits needed salt (there was salt on the table) and the red sauce was really delicious.<br>The kitchen was very slow that day. When our main courses came out they were hot and I really enjoyed the fried pickled eggs benedict, but I wish it had had more fried pickles.<br>I don&#39;t think my friend and I walked away wow&#39;d like we&#39;d hoped but it was A-OK.\"\n",

This is quite a busy place during a random weekday lunch! <br><br>I like that there was plenty of parking options behind the restaurant, since it was also close to a metro station. The restaurant is on the second floor, so you will have to take either flight of the stairs to go up. As soon as you walk up the stairs, you will see a very inviting environment, with string lights and cute outdoor seating for those who want to enjoy a nice day outside. <br><br>My party was seated inside by the window, and I immediately nerded-out looking at their ceiling fans. Their ceiling fans are connected together by a pulley system, and powered by a motor! Pretty darn cool. <br><br>Not knowing what to order, our server first brought us some corn bread to share with some berry-type jam and honey. Mixing the berry jam and the honey together was the best! We then ordered a Grilled cheese pork sandwich and a pork shoulder dish. <br><br>I was actually quite disappointed by the pork shoulder dish. I wish that the meat was a bit more juicy, but most of it was rather dry besides the part that has some fat on top of it. It didn&#39;t have much flavoring besides the toppings on top of the pork shoulder and I wish they had a dry rub or marinated it a bit before cooking it. The Brussels sprouts sides and the fries were amazing though! And the Grilled Cheese Pork Sandwich totally made up for it! It was sweet and salty all mixed together. Although it was slightly on the oily side, it tasted amazing and I didn&#39;t mind. <br><br>Overall, I had a great dining experience here. The ambiance here reminds me of a cute southern town, and I just wish I ordered something else on the menu that they were probably more well known for. Until next time!\"\n",

Yes sir...absolutely delicious. I&#39;d have to say that fried Brussels Sprouts were my favorite. But I also need to mention that the breading on their fried chicken is perfection, you can taste the honey in every bite and it has the tiniest kick with this genius dry seasoning. Washed down by the Tupelo Honey RJ Something or other, and it didn&#39;t disappoint. 5 stars Tupelo Honey and thanks for a great birthday meal.\"\n",

I had the fried okra (sooooo good), avocado toast with over easy eggs, and a side of grits.  My only regret is that I didn&#39;t order a sweet tea as well.  Ha.  <br><br>The space is clean and so are the bathrooms.  Parking is ridiculously difficult at this location, be prepared.  We have had the same waitress the past few times we have been here, and we love her.  Although, she has no control over how slowly the kitchen is working.   If you&#39;re not a Bloody Mary fan, their mimosas are equally delish!\"\n",

Back off - I&#39;m not apologizing. <br>The biscuits - we got them fresh out of the oven and OMG so good. They came with a blueberry sauce and honey. Both were delicious - my husband my have actually licked the bowl the blueberry sauce came in. <br>Pimento nachos (happy hour size) - so delicious. One of the best things I&#39;ve put in my mouth in weeks. 10/10 would eat again <br>Tacos (happy hour - 1 chicken and 1 pork) - the pork was great, Asian inspired. The chicken was good but a little dry. It came with a mustard sauce on the side that the hubs enjoyed (but I don&#39;t eat mustard so can&#39;t personally comment on the sauce). <br>Blue cheese and bacon sauce - the chips this came with were great. The sauce itself was a little thin. Prob the only dish we wouldn&#39;t re-order if we returned here. <br>Fried Mac and cheese balls (happy hour size) - delicious. Do yourself a favor. Order these. <br>Tomato soup - so good! A great spice and heat! <br>Heirloom tomatoes and burrata - loved this! This came near the end when we were slowing down and were unable to finish but damn. <br>Fried okra - so good, maybe could use a little more crispiness. This also came near the end and were so full we couldn&#39;t finish. RIP. <br>Request a seat in Bethany&#39;s section if you can! She was great. Attentive without being obtrusive and she really knew her stuff. <br>Solid 4.5 star experience!\"\n",

I texted my order to my guy since I was arriving later than him and requested &#34;Shoo mercy shrimp and grits&#34;. He showed it to the waitress. What I didn&#39;t know is that Tupelo is now offering less for more. So the &#34;shoo mercy&#34; version with spinach, mushroom, good sauce, bacon, and peppers is no longer. In its place are shrimp &amp; grits with chorizo, sauce, and that&#39;s about it. VERY disappointing, especially considering the cost is what it was when it was filled with goodness. $21.00 My peach lemonade was delicious. <br><br>Chefs reimagining a restaurant&#39;s most popular dishes is a trick of the enemy.

To start the restaurant itself is so precious, we sat outside on the balcony (next to some of the friendliest pups which certainly helped). However it was the food that truly stole the show. <br><br>Each table is presented with homemade biscuits with honey and jam. Perhaps I&#39;m biased since I&#39;m not from the South but these biscuits were worth writing home about! I have never had a starter that was delicious enough to be the main course. My friend and I split the Shoo Mercy Omelet (friend green tomato, smoked ham, bacon, pickled jalapeños and pimento cheese), and the Southern Shakshuka (two baked eggs over goat cheese grits with avocado in a creole sauce). Despite how full I was from the biscuits this food was so insanely delicious that we had to lick the plates clean. I&#39;m a self-proclaimed omelette connoisseur and the Shoo Mercy takes the cake for best omelette I have ever had, and the Shakshuka made me fall in love with grits.

The problems happened as soon as we sat down. They were clearly understaffed and probably should have given fair warning. It took a long time to receive everything. Drinks - fine, understand. But when you bring out cold food, that&#39;s just not acceptable.

The chicken was far from being the best I&#39;d ever had - it was pretty dry, but the sweet tea flavor definitely came through and it was very tasty overall. The star of the meal was the brussel sprouts - absolutely incredible. They were charred and crispy and perfectly seasoned, and our whole table was eyeing them on my plate. I also had the mashed potatoes, which were good but nothing special.<br><br>A few of our party&#39;s guests got the shrimp and grits and said that it was excellent. Their beer and wine selection, as well as their cocktails, all received rave reviews. <br><br>I still want to visit Tupelo for brunch, but I won&#39;t return for dinner. Drinks and side dishes are the stars here. 5 stars for the excellent service - the staff were friendly, patient, and even provided us an extra table for the birthday boy&#39;s gifts. As with all large groups, there were a few members of our party that were difficult, and the staff handled it very gracefully.\"\n",

            "5Cs1RzzFcOFA6yCKIYCE7Q,\"I was excited to try this restaurant while in town on a combo vacation/work trip. A local friend had recommended it, and I chose it over a couple other options for brunch based primarily on the Banana Pudding Dream pancakes I saw on their menu online. I&#39;d made a reservation online and was seated immediately when I arrived. My server, Cinthia, was friendly and attentive throughout my visit. When she found out it was my first visit, she took the time to tell me about the menu and the restaurant. The meal started with a warm biscuit with honey and blueberry compote, which was delicious and got my meal off to a great start. After the biscuit, I was really excited to get my pancakes! Unfortunately, I ended up being really disappointed though. The menu description of the dish is: &#34;dollops of creamy banana pudding, caramel drizzle, crumbled vanilla wafer, served with whipped cream and powdered sugar.&#34; What I got is: the pancakes with the dollops of banana pudding, and a sprinkle of powdered sugar. No caramel drizzle, no crumbled vanilla wafers, no whipped cream. Half the ingredients were missing! Cinthia came by after the plate was delivered to my table and commented that it looked a bit empty and told me that she had asked the kitchen to bring me some bananas to add to the dish. I thought I might at least get some caramelized bananas to add to the pancakes, but what they brought me was a cup of cold banana slices. Still not up to the menu description. What was on the plate tasted great, but it just wasn&#39;t the more unique, special dish I thought I&#39;d be getting based on the menu description. Next time I&#39;m in town I&#39;ll probably choose another brunch location.\"\n",

We both split the fried okra. To start off with we didn&#39;t have silverware when we sat down. Once we put in our order for the okra within two min (I&#39;m not kidding) it came out. Normally I would be impressed however the dish was room temp and old tasting (like it had just been sitting on a plate waiting for a table to take it). After that we didn&#39;t receive biscuits until AFTER our entrees arrived, which seemed weird because my boyfriend&#39;s dish had three biscuits in it (?). Anyways, my four sides were just fine, but his serving was very very small, and the chicken was just average, not crispy or fresh. Not at all what we were expecting for the price they charge.<br><br>Overall, the food was OK but not $50 for brunch OK. We were quite disappointed.

No indication of that on the menu. Been sick the rest of the day from the awful heavy taste. So instead of tasting avocado and eggs I could only taste that heavy grilled cheese-that which you&#39;d get at a lower end restaurant. My husband&#39;s meal wasn&#39;t great either. Maybe the worst meal we&#39;ve had in months. No comp or free biscuits for the 1hr 15 min wait. I ended all of this by a trip to the ladies restroom.

Two pieces of bacon, and some amazing butter and syrup. (See my picture). All of the flavors went together perfectly and it was really good!!!! I try to eat healthy most of the time but I didn&#39;t mind splurging for this.<br><br>To top it off Tupelo had sent me a coupon to sample their mason jar desserts.  O.M.G. These were sooooooo good! My favorite was the peanut butter one with pretzels and chocolate.  We left stuffed and happy.\"\n",

Our waiter was very friendly and the biscuits to start with were delicious.<br><br>I wasn&#39;t really sure what I wanted for dinner and nothing really jumped out at me at first glance. They have a burger on the menu that had toppings (pork confit, cheese sauce) that just didn&#39;t appeal to me so I asked if I could order a regular burger without all of that. I was told that wasn&#39;t possible. I understand that chefs want their food eaten a certain way but it was just a little bit odd to me. <br><br>I ended up ordering the short rib, which came with roasted carrots, potatoes, and a spring pea cream. It was really delicious. The short rib was good but the veggies were honestly the best part of the meal. Overall it was a fun place to visit but from what I understand it may be a better choice for brunch than dinner.\"\n",

I looked on yelp because the place also had to be pet friendly being that I had my dog with me. This restaurant popped up and I&#39;m so glad we came here. Also when we got there, we assumed it was popular because it was a lot of people coming in and out and it was a hour wait for 2 people. We were fine with it and went across the street to Dunkin until they were ready to text us to be seated. I ordered fried chicken (dark meat) with a side of French toast. The chicken was so crispy and juicy! And y&#39;all, the French toast, omg, delicious. I hate when French toast taste doughy or undercooked and this place cooked the French toast wonderfully. We sat outside and my dog, Hershey, was chillin on his bed. They have dog bowls for water to give to the dogs, which is nice. Will definitely come back.\"\n",

Overall, we waited about 10 - 12 minutes for these things to come out to us while the rest of our food was getting cold. When the bacon was brought to our table one of the servers sat it down saying &#34;here is your extra, extra, extra crispy bacon&#34; - it wasn&#39;t crispy, it was burnt. Surely, there is a medium between undercooked food and over cooked food - and there is, it&#39;s properly cooked food. After waiting and then receiving burnt bacon none of the food was appetizing anymore and I was really disappointed. <br><br>When our server came back we asked her to speak to the manager, after explaining to the manager what happened she offered to take the bacon off our bill and give us the &#34;family and friends discount.&#34; We then waited another 15 - 20 minutes for our checks to be organized and pay. <br><br>From now on, I will stick to the Greenville location where my experience has always been great.\"\n",

Asked for fully cooked bacon (another 10 mins) and the girl (not our server) brought it to the table and said &#34;here&#39;s your extra extra extra crispy bacon&#34; with an attitude. We asked for the manager and she asked what was good about our dining experience. NOTHING. Everything was cold and what we tasted, wasn&#39;t great.

I was wise enough to make reservations and we had little to no wait time as there were plenty of patrons waiting to get seated.<br><br>I started out with a Megamosa (large mimosa) and they brought biscuits, fresh blueberry jam, and honey to the table. I couldn&#39;t help but to indulge while my hubby continuously battled back and forth over his brunch selections.  The jam was delicious as well as the honey atop of the biscuit. We both ordered the Shoo-Mercy Sweet Potato and I must say, it was one of THE best breakfast entreés we&#39;ve had in quite awhile from any restaurant.  The sweet potato pancakes along with the fried chicken breast were soooo delish!!! It was a perfect combination. The baked apple as well as the eggs were nice accompaniments. It comes with bacon as well, but I had mine without the bacon.<br><br>I did kinda regret eating that biscuit as the Shoo-Mercy won the battle.

            "Hqh3__TgG8hNSGnnmuEYhQ,\"Saturday morning brunch in Charlotte. This place is a nice southern style farm to table type restaurant. Their brunch reminds me of this place called noble crust in St. Petersburg, FL. <br><br>We were seated immediately. It is spacious with an open kitchen , so you can see the food cooking. I got the pre fix menu and they offered two choices between appetizers and an entree. I went with the pear salad and the crab Benedict with bottomless coffee.<br><br>They started us out with biscuits with homemade blueberry jam. The jam looked extremely fresh with the berries still intact. The pear salad was pretty but kind of hard to eat with the big Bibb lettuce. It was a nice light start to get some good greens in. If your trying to keep a more trim meal I would go with this vs the avocado toast. <br><br>The crab Benedict was ok. The best part was the biscuit but it was kind of lukewarm. It wasn&#39;t something that I would rave about. I swapped out the potato cracklin with the Brussel Sprouts. I loved those. Very crispy and flavorful. It was only an extra dollar to do so. The other items on the menu looked amazing and it was kind of hard to pick what I wanted. This is somewhere I would definitely come back to when I am in Charlotte again.\"\n",

Their food doesn&#39;t feel stuffy or heavy.<br><br>I have had one disappointing meal here and to be fair, I was forewarned...making the avocado toast gluten free left the heart a little to be desired. Assuming their portions of avocado doesn&#39;t change from regular bread to GF bread, it could have used a little, well, more.<br><br>They cut the toast into little slivers, and GF bread is always smaller. One modification would have been to cut the bread into a triangle and have left it. I actually sort of chuckled when it came and I was like, &#34;wow the server is right, this looks pretty dismal.&#34; <br><br>Their side salad is one of the best I have had, it isn&#39;t pathetic--it&#39;s actually gorgeous. Mixed greens with carrots, a beautiful watermelon radish on top. Oh and their blueberry jam. *swoon* I absolutely love smathering this over toast alongside a mug of piping hot coffee.<br><br>If you go for brunch...the potatoes. oh my goodness the potatoes. are like this smashed, but still whole, concoction. I loved them. Great flavor, a few bits of crunchy bits mixed in...mmmm yum.<br><br>The wait is always incredibly long. And I will say, I won&#39;t wait more than probably 20-30 minutes. If you find yourself up early enough on a weekend to visit, make the trip, otherwise, expect upwards of an hour. And while it&#39;s really solid, I just don&#39;t know what is worth an hour wait.<br><br>Love that this place has stayed true to their roots and has expanded over southern cities!\"\n",

It took a very long time to come out and when it did, it looked like it was sitting under the heating lamp a bit too long.

The sweet tea was delicious, the complimentary biscuits were meh! Their menu is very limited and to my surprise they DO NOT serve any mashed potatoes! Unreal, a southern restaurant that doesn&#39;t serve mash is blasphemy. <br><br> From their limited menu I picked the Blackened Catfish which was very fishy accompanied with baked Mac &amp; Cheese and French fries. The sides were actually pretty good. We also ordered the Buttermilk Fried Chicken and that was very good! <br><br>Their portions are fair, but their prices are steep. The sweet tea is delicious and as usual it&#39;s free refills. <br><br>The main reason for the 2 star review is due to the limited menu with no mashed potato on it, and the absurdly small portion of banana pudding which they charge $6.50 for! The container is so tiny and to make matters worse, they don&#39;t even fill the container! GREEDY!!! <br><br>It&#39;s definitely not an authentic Southern Restaurant and more of a tourist trap.

We made a reservation ahead of time using OpenTable and there was only a 5-6 minute wait versus a couple who walked in after and was told 40-45 minutes. Now that that&#39;s out of the way, get started. They start you off with housemade biscuits accompanied by honey and blueberry jam. They were really good. Crunchy tops but the inside was soft and fluffy. For an appetizer we got the crispy brussel sprouts. Very delicious and seasoned well. Lived up to the name, crispy. Definitely crisp, not burnt. We were going to try their dip with the collard greens but the manager informed us that the entire batch of it was ruined and there was none available for the day. Smh<br><br>The egg rolls were good but normally if the filling is savory, I prefer a sweet sauce. There&#39;s was a mustardy looking Sauce but wasn&#39;t sweet.

The Mac and cheese was pretty decent and the collards could use some more salt. Other than that this place is very lively and the atmosphere is great. Had the rosemary peach lemonade.

They eventually came back out, but not much better.  The benedict eggs were hardly runny at all, and the french toast apparently used Wonder bread, and was heaped with the largest mound of ultra-sweet pecan pie filling that it was practically inedible.  The waitress wanted to argue when we sent them back saying that the eggs were supposed to be that way and that the french toast &#34;didn&#39;t have any egg&#34; because it was french toast.  Huh??!!!<br><br>Anyway, normally when a business shows an interest in their customer&#39;s experiences when contacted directly, I will give them another chance, but since they don&#39;t care, I thought I better warn people about this location:  if you have had a great meal at other locations, prepare to be sorely disappointed at this one.\"\n",

            "eoChBKtvB8itLxfDXiypmA,\"I stopped by this large cafe in Charlotte to do brunch with a few friends and had a decent dining experience. The location is a little hidden as we had to climb a few stairs up the side of a building to find it. When you walk in you are greeted by a very large dining hall which is almost overwhelming when you first walk in (probably because it was brunch and filled with hungry diners). However, seating was pretty quick even having a group of 5 people. As for the food the menu was southern cuisine based and I ended up ordering the fried chicken and biscuits which came smothered in white gravy. The chicken was amazing well seasoned and crispy without being hard and over fried although I could have done without the entire bowl of gravy provided with it. Of course you can&#39;t have a good brunch without mimosas in which we all ordered the Tupelo honey mimosas which were served in a glass that resembled more of a wine glass or goblet opposed to the traditional champagne flutes most restaurants serve mimosas in to stretch out the quantities but the trade off was not having a bottomless option. The only complaint I would provide is that it took about 35-40 minutes for one of my friends dishes to arrive who ordered the honey dusted fried chicken (in fairness she was the last to order of the group). However, the waitress and manager were quick to acknowledge the issue without being asked and continued to inform us of the updates with regards to the delay and gave her the meal free of charge due to the discrepancy which was very considerate. All in all we had a pretty solid brunch experience and I&#39;d definitely look forward to returning to try some of their dinner menu items.\"\n",

This comes pretty close to the shrimp and grits.<br><br>Biscuits with homemade jam and tupelo honey - for some reason they never brought these out til halfway through our meal.  YAAAAAAAAS these are amazing, especially with the tupelo honey (the best!) and homemade berry jam.<br><br>Pecan pie - skip.  I&#39;ve had better elsewhere.  Or maybe we were just too full.<br><br>Solid place for good service, great Southern food, and groups (on weekday evenings).\"\n",

The mix of foods and flavors was not a typical offering at all, but a mix of some good &#39;ol southern cooking and some Cajun and/or Creole flavors that were a real treat, and I can&#39;t wait to go again. I&#39;ve come to expect a &#34;plainness&#34;, or unexciting mouth-feel and taste from most of today&#39;s quick restaurants, but this wasn&#39;t the case at all. The food filled my mouth with flavor, hitting on various parts of my tongue, much like a fine, full-bodied wine. Sounds a bit hokie I know, but that&#39;s the best way I can think of to describe the experience. The tastes were full and distinctive: savory and salty and sweet, all in the same bite. Definitely a real treat! <br><br>My review is based off a single, first time visit, and if I lived just a little closer, I&#39;d have gone back several times already. <br><br>I was shocked to learn as I was leaving that it&#39;s actually a chain restaurant. I asked. The food and flavors were much more like a local Mom &amp; Pop place, which I tend to seek out. Regardless, &#34;I&#39;ll be back!&#34;\"\n",

I had to clutch my pearls! SCORCHED MAC AND CHEESE!!! What the what??? I will say, however, the biscuits were really, really good. But there was no honey butter. Where was the honey butter? And the peach butter that they used to serve with the sweet potato pancakes? Where was it? Twice I heard, &#34;I&#39;m sorry.

I am glad I ordered the flounder, but the fried chicken will most certainly be ordered on a return visit. Hushpuppies are an obvious choice for a side and while the mac n cheese wasn&#39;t anything extraordinary, it did hit the spot. Options for my vegetarian friend and the salad options were serious, although probably not that healthy. I liked the decorations and well-appointed bathroom. The service was great and parking easy, although we were there on the earlier side of the dinner rush at 6:15pm.<br><br>I would like to go back to try their $6 Monday special on Shoo Mercy Burgers or $3 Taco Tuesdays and some may like the $10 bottomless mac-n-cheese on Wednesdays, but I believe they have already changed their menu, so keep an eye on their evolution.

Today I had brunch at the Charlotte location and was less than impressed. <br><br>We had a party of 6 and our reservation was at 12:30. We waited quite a while past 12:30 to be seated, but we didn&#39;t mind that so much because they comped us two appetizers for the inconvenience. <br><br>The appetizers were great. We got the fried green tomatoes and avocado toast points. My entree wasn&#39;t great. I had the Old Skool breakfast bowl, sub scrambled eggs for over easy. My friend ordered the same bowl and had different modifications. When our meals arrived (after a lengthy wait) my scrambled egg bowl had her modifications, and her bowl had over easy eggs but no modifications. This was pointed out to our server. It wasn&#39;t a huge deal but since we didn&#39;t get what we ordered, a discount might have been appropriate. The bowl itself was sort of flavorless and the grits were dry. <br><br>The service was not what I would expect. Our waitress didn&#39;t know anything about the drink I ordered (lavender limeade which was delicious by the way). It took a long time to get our food (not the server&#39;s fault) and an absurdly long time to get our checks. <br><br>I don&#39;t think I would return to this location, but would happily return to Asheville or Raleigh!\"\n",

However, after our experience today we will not be dining Tupelo Honey again. <br><br>First, we had issues with both of our orders. My coworker asked for the Mountain Harvest Bowl that has grilled chicken on the salad. The grilled chicken was extremely pink and undercooked so she asked politely for the chicken to be placed back on the grill to be cooked more. After 1 MINUTE a disgruntled server came back out saying this should be cooked to your liking (please note: the chicken is still VERY pink). My food in particular came out wrong as I had asked for gravy on the side of my buttermilk chicken breast. My meal was smothered in gravy and I asked politely for them to take the gravy off only to be met with the same attitude as my coworker received. (Typically I am not one who sends food back but the gravy took up the whole meal.) <br><br>When we received the checks my coworkers meal was free (which was great of Tupelo to acknowledge). My meal however was $15.27 and I placed a $20 bill within the bill fold. The server came back moments later asking if I wanted change with an attitude. As a previous server myself this is not something you should ask a customer if they do not say &#34;keep the change&#34;. I responded that I would like change. I was met with a smirking server coming back to the table looking me dead in the eyes and handing me a $5 bill. This was very uncomfortable for my coworker and me knowing that this was out of spite since I asked for change. <br><br>Although all of this transpired I still left him the $5 tip plus my coworker giving him a $3 tip as well. We are overall very disappointed in the quality of the food, but more so the disrespectful server. WILL NOT BE COMING BACK.\"\n",

I understood since it was a Saturday, but was confused when a family of four came in and was seated right away (they didn&#39;t have a reservation and the waitress immediately took them to their seats). There were so many tables open outside (ones for two and four people) and inside the cafe so I don&#39;t understand why we had to wait 30 minutes for a table that had been open the entire time. When we were seated, the service was absolutely terrible. No silverware, no attention from the waiter, and took forever to even order drinks. Once we finally ordered and got our food, the food was just alright. The biscuits that came out beforehand were okay. I got the breakfast combo with eggs, bacon, and sweet potato pancakes. My meal was just alright, I didn&#39;t feel as if there was anything special about it.

All I can say about the experience is &#34;meh&#34; <br><br>The restaurant is adorable, their outdoor seating area is wonderful on a nice day. It is a super cute place. <br><br>The service is so-so. Sorta slow, we had 2 napkins on our table and it was like pulling teeth to get more brought to us. Our drinks came out 20 minutes after our appetizers. I always find it sort of strange when restaurants do this, I like my drinks first, I ordered them first after all. I understand the bartender may be a bit backed up. But that sorta sounds like an issue with staffing.. <br><br>Now to the food! Absolutely disappointing. I&#39;m starting to think this place really excels in brunch food, because the lunch food was just unimpressive, bland, and poorly executed. <br><br>We tried the fried green tomatoes, we figured it would be fun to try some southern food. Wow were they bland! They sounded so good on the menu with the goat cheese. My god, throw a bit of garlic and some herbs in your breading. They were so absolutely bland, what a missed opportunity. How do you mess up tomatoes?!<br><br>The egg salad and avocado sandwich was much the same. It was avocado spread with a sliced hard boiled egg. Everything was slippery so it just slid out of the bread. And again, more blandness. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s a southern thing but I like for my food to have a bit of flavor to it! <br><br>Don&#39;t really understand the biscuit with jam for lunch, but the biscuits were truly delicious and flaky. <br><br>But I wouldn&#39;t recommend this place for lunch. Was not impressed with the food at all.\"\n",

Set atop of a bed of grits, the red pepper coulis adds brightness and interest to a dish that begs for a spatula scrape or a brownie spoon lick at the end. <br><br>The sweet potato pancake, if just a tad bit on the dryer side, is accompanied by near perfectly cooked fried chicken and a maple pepper bacon that adds to the complexity to the dish. <br><br>The heaping 26 dollar portion of Shoo Fly Shrimp and Grits loads every bite with shrimp, so much so that they I believe this to be the first time I&#39;ve ever taken home a shrimp dish with shrimp to be had. The spicy mix of peppers and mushrooms flavors the dish well, and I order chorizo on the side expecting crushed or cubed pieces, but instead get large moderately thick slices of the dark red spicy meat. <br><br>Pork egg rolls have the appearance of being hastily rolled and are a bit too greasy for my liking.

I grabbed a reservation 2-3 days before the day we wanted to go and I&#39;m certainly glad I did. When we got there it seemed as though all of Charlotte was there! I picked 10:45 on Opentable and we waited only about 5 minutes for our table to be cleared. Keep in mind to add a few minutes to try and find parking as its limited. Tupelo is very close to the E/W Blvd Lynxx stop though too. <br>We started with the fried green tomatoes which I di denjoy. They are nestled in a red pepper sauce which screamed Spring to me. Four slices come in an order.<br>By 11 am, they were out of what my companions wanted to eat; huevos rancheros. So, one went with the southwestern omelet with chorizo, avocado and cheese/salsa/sour cream. Its big; probably a 3 egg omelet. She added grits. The other dining companion ordered the Eggs Betty which is their take on a benedict. Its pretty traditional. I ordered the avocado toast. Gotta eat it quickly if you don&#39;t want the avocado to make the thick, country slice of bread soggy. It was a generous amount of avocado though. It comes with some dressed greens and beets. The greens were soggy so maybe too heavily dressed. <br>My favorite thing I ate was the potato cracklins on the sides menu. Those are a must in my opinion!<br>They have your standard mimosas and bloody marys, etc., but they are charging a hefty price for them. Get a glass of rose instead!\"\n",

As this is their busiest service, you think they would be better prepared and have more staff. <br><br>We came for Sunday brunch and waited at least half an hour just to get a drink at the bar.

Several times our drink orders were forgotten and we had to continue to let the waitress know we hadn&#39;t gotten our drinks. Even worse, by this point the crowd had cleared, so we couldn&#39;t figure out why service was still so slow. <br><br>AN HOUR AND FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER....we let our waitress know we still hadn&#39;t received her food. We told her it had been over an hour and she was surprised by this! It was like she had no idea. She went to talk to the kitchen and food came out soon after. <br><br>After all of that, my food was COLD. The manager came over and tried to tell me that the crab Benedict was a &#34;cold crab salad.&#34; I let her know my eggs and biscuit were cold as well and she continued to try and tell me that the dish was served cold because of the crab salad. Cold eggs and a cold biscuit?! Gross. I ate two bites and left my plate. <br><br>I believe the manager eventually handled the situation well, but she wouldn&#39;t drop the fact that it was supposed to have been a cold dish.

The star of the show to me here is the home fries. I think they are awesome and really like it with the hot sauce. My boyfriend had the southern fried BLT (add pimento cheese) and it was tasty. He also liked the fries. <br><br>I also had the sweet potato pancake. It was just okay to me. It is one giant and thick pancake, which makes it really hard to eat. I barely ate 1/3 of it because it was so massive. It was the only pancake they had on the menu, which was disappointing because I really like pancakes. <br><br>The negatives for me about this place is that there always seems to be a wait, food can take a long time to come out because it&#39;s so busy, there isn&#39;t an extensive brunch menu (and I love brunch), and it&#39;s kinda expensive (specifically the bar drinks). <br><br>Overall, I think this place is okay.

But the amazing shakshuka and goat cheese grits lured us back.  This time the ticketing system was down, kitchen orders were crazy backed up, orders came out in unusual patterns (one person got their breakfast 15 minutes before everyone else) and one breakfast was cold to the touch (and not made to order).  We didn&#39;t ask for a manager, but the server said they would bring a manager over anyway, likely just to smooth things over.  But a manager never came.  4 of the 5 breakfasts were delicious.  They also didn&#39;t charge us for our drinks and single cold breakfast, which was kind.

They have some traditional southern soul food with a twist. I ordered the shrimp and grits and they did not disappoint. One of the best shrimp and grits in Charlotte for sure. The chicken and waffles are also quite popular here and are also really tasty. They staff was extremely nice and welcoming and the ambiance was nice as well. Would definitely return.\n",

I had to go to the hostess after we were sat because we sat at our table for 15 minutes without knowing who our server was. Our waitress disappeared after she took our drink order. She comes back 20 mins later to take our food order. We waited another 45 minutes with empty glasses and no food on the table. I approached the hostess again to speak to the manager. They comped our entire meal. The comp wasn&#39;t what we were seeking, but it was appreciated that they did all they could do at that point to make us happy. However, we will never return due to that experience alone. The food was decent, but not enough to outweigh the poor service.\"\n",

When most of us don&#39;t care what time it is anyway.<br><br>Located in the center of &#34;Southend&#34;, Tupelo Honey is where it&#39;s at! I have eaten here for years and recommend it to friends and family. It is somewhere I go when I have extra cash and looking to impress. Haven&#39;t seen a friend in awhile and have PLENTY of time to catch up? Well, then this is the place to go. Why? Because the service moves very slow. Not sure if they do this because they believe, the longer you&#39;re there the more you will spend, but It happens every time I visit. However, this is the only thing I can find wrong with it.<br><br>Aside from the slow service, I think the food is to die for! It is healthy and hearty, and the portions are huge. Definitely not a tapas restaurant here! During my latest visit, I had the eggs Benedict with goat cheese grits. I love anything with goat cheese so I went with my gut, and boy was I right! <br><br>this restaurant is unique because they bring a fancy twist to Southern style food.

We decided to grab a seat at the bar for convenience. There was one bartender behind the bar, who seemed more than a little irritated that we decided to sit there. She was busy making all of the drinks for the remainder of the restaurant, and wasn&#39;t able to provide the best customer service to the customers sitting at the bar (it steadily got busier over the course of our visit). <br><br>Tupelo has a decent selection of Mimosas and Bloody Marys, which was by far the bright spot of our visit.  I&#39;ve eaten here a few times in the past, and always remembered a broad selection of standard breakfast fare, as well as some more interesting plates to choose from. It seems now that the entire menu is trying too hard, for lack of a better phrase. I ordered the Appalachian breakfast, and my other guest ordered the hash. Both of our plates came out with cold eggs. <br><br>With so many different places to choose from to eat brunch with consistent service and at least better (hotter) food, I&#39;m going to scratch Tupelo off the list for now.\"\n",

Yes, it&#39;s true that the food may take awhile here, but I have not experienced the biscuit shortage again that I described in the below. Yes, the servers may take a little bit longer to come visit you but that&#39;s because this place is so popular they are slammed on the weekends! Yes, it&#39;s true you will wait a long time to be seated on the weekends if you don&#39;t make reservations. <br><br>Additionally, I now only come here if I make reservations and it makes a world of a difference, so thank you Tupelo for taking them!<br><br>Finally, I was recently impressed when I took my sister here for her birthday for brunch and they let her pick out any dessert she wanted for free! The banana pudding was outstanding! <br><br>Overall, this is now my go-to brunch spot in Charlotte whenever I have visitors in town. Just don&#39;t forget to make a reservation and you will love the Tupelo Honey Cafe!  <br><br>-------<br><br>3 stars for service and price, 4 stars for food and decor. Allow me to elaborate...<br><br>Pros: <br>-Yummy breakfast with a southern spin. Every entree comes with a complimentary homemade biscuit with jam &#34;prior&#34; to your meal. (This was not my experience, see below) <br><br>-Free parking for guests, located in a mini shopping center. <br><br>-If seated at bar, snow/ice is wrapped around on bar to keep your drink cold (see picture). Cool idea! <br><br>Cons: <br>-Slow service. Don&#39;t come here on a Sunday when you need to have a quick breakfast. I specifically asked if I needed to order toast with my meal (not included, an extra $1) since I ordered over easy eggs, and I was assured &#34;No, since a biscuit will come prior to your meal.&#34; This was wrong. I waited 10 minutes after my meal came for this biscuit,  before I could even eat my eggs, which by then was cold.<br><br>-Wait will most likely be 30 minutes to sit on a Sunday unless you grab a seat at the bar. Expect longer for a big party.<br><br>-Coffee is $3 and their large soup-like mugs make the coffee go cold pretty quickly unless you drink it fast. And when you do drink it fast, don&#39;t expect it to get refilled fast. I had to ask for refills 4x. Not once did my waitress offer to refill my coffee.\"\n",

The first few times it was stellar. The more I went, I found that it was either a really bad experience or pretty good. It seems like the quality of the food has gone down as of late. The service is hit or miss out of my 12 or so visits here; you&#39;re either getting drinks and biscuits you didn&#39;t know you needed right as you sit down, or waiting 30 minutes for a mimosa at brunch. <br><br>One thing that&#39;s always been ridiculous...the wait times. If you&#39;re looking to go during the weekend and this is your first trip, you will be terribly mistaken to think you will get a table within any reasonable time frame. Booking a reservation the night before is your best bet, but even then it&#39;s not guaranteed you will be seated at the time you reserve. On the other hand, I have experienced them grossly overestimate the wait time (they said maybe 45 mins. and it ended up being 10 mins.). <br><br>With all of that out of the way, the food is absolutely Southern inspired and some things are reminiscent of a dish my grandmother would cook on a Saturday morning for me. I have yet to have anything that was just flat out bad, but I have had a couple of things that were WAY overpriced for what you get (mainly the drinks). Their margins are ridiculous, but hey...gotta pay that Southend lease! <br><br>By all means check it out, but only if you have a 2-3 hour time span to wait and eat.\"\n",

The toast was stale and tasteless, and even worse, the avocado was dark green and freezing cold. It was hard to swallow, knowing I would have to hand over $15.00 for ingredients that were definitely far from fresh. My husband had fried chicken and a biscuit, and the biscuit was dry and pretty rock hard. He reports that the chicken was stiff, not very fresh, and a bit overdone. Our kids shared pancakes and scrambled eggs. They said the pancakes were fine, but the scrambled eggs were lukewarm and a bit too wet. To top it off, our table was super sticky, as were the bathroom floors. I&#39;m guessing that it&#39;s just not the most well-managed place in the world and that they&#39;re trying to do too much -- we got our food at the same time we got our drinks, and the check was on our table 30 seconds after we swallowed our last bites.

We waited at the empty table we found for a few minutes before she came to wipe it off. We pretty much new what we wanted so we were ready to go, ordered the fried green tomatoes to split and then I ordered the Eggs Betty and he ordered the Fried chicken platter with fried okra. The place got pretty crowded after we sat down so the food took a bit. I was super excited to try their biscuits and berry preserve but, the server never brought them by! <br><br>Our fried green tomatoes came out, yum!!! The bf loved the goat cheese grits even though he hates goat cheese normally..shhhh I didn&#39;t tell him. Very creamy, delish. The actual tomatoes were fried to perfection with the perfect amount of batter but, a little too thick of a tomato slice. Still very good with the flavorful red pepper coolie. I couldn&#39;t help myself after we finished the fried green tomatoes and asked the server to bring out the complimentary biscuits and preserves everyone else but us received (docked a star). I&#39;m so glad I did because they were so good! Buttery, flaky goodness! The preserves are spot on! They have blackberry but you can also buy to take home and they have strawberry and blueberry preserves as well. This would be perfect if served with honey butter or something. <br><br>The entrees! I was already full at this point so its just nibbling from here on out. My Eggs Betty included the most perfect poached eggs I&#39;ve ever tasted, wonderfully runny! YUMM! The potato cracklins were super crispy but, needed some seasoning. All in all great entree that will for sure leave you in food coma status. The bf scarfed his fried chicken down, I didn&#39;t even get try try any lol. But, his fried okra side was perfect! Not too heavily battered but, still very crispy and extra fresh! I will be getting these next time. <br><br>The server took her time bringing the check out, we were basically sitting there for 30 minutes after we finished eating.

I called Tupelo Honey to see if they did bottomless mimosas, the hostess on the phone assured me they did, and continued to confirm my 21st birthday reservation. I was very excited to be a guest, as I have always drove past Tupelo Honey &amp; heard many good things about it.<br>I arrived, and told my server, Matt, that I was starving. He quickly suggested we get the crispy brussels sprouts because they come out quickly. We agreed, and Matt left and returned with the brussels maybe less than a minute later. The brussels were overcooked, unseasoned and cold. How can something be overcooked AND cold? Theres no way they were made to order. My server brought me old, cold Brussels. And for a place describing itself as &#34;new southern flavors&#34;, the cold ranch dressing that came with them on the side was metiocre at best. I was famished so I ate them anyway.<br><br>It was a rocky start to say the least. Matt soon after brought us a bowl of biscuits with jam on the side, told me he didn&#39;t want me to starve. I love when my servers take the initiative like that, totally made up for the so-so brussels. <br><br>Later, we ordered our entrees. My friend ordered a chicken Cobb salad, and I let Matt order for me. I always do that when I go to new restaurants-it allows me to see what real flavors/originality the kitchen is capable of, as well as allows me to have a culinary connection with my server. It also gives my server the opportunity to make my bill higher. Matt told us that the new menu was a week old, so I was excited to try something new! He asked me if there were any dietary restrictions he should be aware of, and I told him I don&#39;t eat pork-so no bacon or ham. He did not write our order down.<br><br>Food comes out, my friend&#39;s salad was like 80% lettuce. Very little toppings. Matt tells me that he ordered me a &#34;Biscuits. Gravy. Chicken.&#34; ....So, he brought me a bowl that consisted of the biscuits that I had just finished eating, and was garnished with bacon bits. After I specifically told him I don&#39;t eat pork. And to top it all off, it was freezing cold. <br>It was my 21st birthday for crying out loud. <br><br>I told Matt about it, sent it back, and asked for a menu. &#34;I&#39;ll just order for myself&#34;, I said. Matt came back and said he can remake the bowl. No Matt. I don&#39;t want a remake of the cold bowl with biscuits I had just eaten. I&#39;ll pass. So I started looking over the menu and Matt came back and said &#34;Avocado toast might be good.&#34; <br>What poor salesmanship. I don&#39;t want something &#34;that might be good.&#34; But I was tired of looking over the menu, so I agreed to his suggestion. <br>Matt never, NEVER, apologized for giving me a pork covered bowl to begin with.<br><br>My friend&#39;s chicken on her Cobb salad got cold while we were waiting for my remake to come out. Never did he offer to replace her food. My plate finally comes out, my eggs were cooked to perfection, an awesome medium cooked egg. The avocado toast was just that-some bread with avocado on top. No originality, no twist on southern flavors. Bland. In the middle was an undressed salad with ONE carrot slice and two watermelon radish slices on top. All I could think was what a pathetic attempt this was at a breakfast plate. So not worth it-I could make that at home. <br><br>I was no longer interested in communicating my dissatisfaction with Matt. He didn&#39;t care, clearly. I was waiting for a manager to perform a table touch at my table, which never happened. I thought it was standard for a manager to come by when food gets sent back...but not at Tupelo Honey, apparently. My friend and I looked around and understood why this experience was happening. There were servers not wearing non slip shoes, a server walking around (indoors) with a pair of yellow sunglasses, servers with their hair down, fooling around, playing, etc...It was in such disarray. Such disorganization. There is clearly noone setting the example at Tupelo, no real leader in charge. It&#39;s a dumping ground where half-ass employees come and put in minimal effort.<br><br>I never told Matt what our reason was for visiting, I assumed the hostess would&#39;ve communicated that to him, and that a birthday cake or something would come out at the end of my meal. It should be a huge priority for hostesses too communicate special occassions to servers. But alas, no cake. No well wishes. Not even an inquiry of why we were visiting. Every department in Tupelo failed me.<br><br>I will forever be ashamed that I wasted some of my 21st birthDAY at a place as pathetic as Tupelo Honey.<br>The hostesses didn&#39;t communicate our occasion.<br>The server didn&#39;t write our order down, thus brought incorrect food. Did not apologize. Was not personable.<br>Kitchen served me cold, bland food. Twice.<br>Never did we see a manager on the floor.<br><br>0/10, will forever advise people to go somewhere OTHER than Tupelo Honey.\"\n",

The service was alright, the food was okay, and it was overpriced. <br><br>I had the avocado and grilled chicken sandwich with a side of fries. The avocado was browned, the chicken was so tough there is no way it was fresh (definitely frozen for a while), and there was little seasoning on it. My boyfriend got the same thing as I did and his meal arrived cold, with very little avocado, and half the amount of fries as me. <br><br>I will say that their biscuits were fantastic!

Reason for the 3 stars is the main dish. Had a fried chicken BLT, bun was a little burnt and the chicken was a bit over cooked which made it tougher to eat. Basically it was OK. Otherwise a cool place. Worth checking out to form a opinion on the food yourself. I could&#39;ve just had a sandwich that wasn&#39;t prepared per their usual standard.\"\n",

What happened next was appalling. <br><br>I ordered drinks and didn&#39;t receive it for 40mins. I asked the waitress about it who became defensive because she felt as if I was rushing the bartender.

I started off with the Moonswine Mary, a 16 oz. jalapeño-infused moonshine Bloody Mary with bacon garnish. Just the right amount of spice from the pepper, and you can never go wrong with bacon. <br><br>For eats, I decided on the Super Southern Breakfast Bowl. Layered black-eyed peas, grits, eggs, bacon, cheese, and salsa. I&#39;m not a big fan of peas (it&#39;s a texture thing) but everything was delicious. The grits were just thick enough, the eggs were great, and the two thick slices of bacon was a perfect addition. <br><br>My fiance got the fried chicken with a side of fried okra, which both were out of this world. The okra was fried just enough to still retain it&#39;s crispy crunch and the chicken breast melted in your mouth the the creamy milk gravy. <br><br>My brother got the Southern Fried Chicken BLT, which was HUGE! Mostly had to deconstruct and reconstruct it to be able to eat, but he had no complaints. He also opted for the fried okra side.<br><br>Sister-in-law got the Shoo Mercy Pancake. It came with candied pecans on top, which were not listed on the menu, so she removed those, but everything else was great with hers. <br><br>Would definitely recommend, and will definitely be back for more at some point.

I was just disappointed they didn&#39;t have what was displayed on the menu. <br><br>(ii) Fried Green Tomatoes - These were alright as well. The tomatoes were a little TOO tart and the breading was (slightly) falling off of the tomato especially if you added any kind of sauce/aioli to it. <br><br>(iii) Seared Southern Scallops - For the price that it was, it could have been better. Also, the scallops were a bit too charred on both sides and the presentation was kind of sloppy. All of the colors were kind of murky, brown, darkish, but the flavor made up for it. I&#39;ve had some amazingly clean tasting scallops and this didn&#39;t hold up to my standard, They did give enough of everything else on the plate, but the main attraction wasn&#39;t prominent. <br><br>Decor - Very nice, southern, hometown but (medium) upscale kind of feel.

Thankfully we made it this time. <br><br>This beautiful work of art is called the &#34;Queen Mary&#34;, appropriate for the Queen City and is the creation of Tupelo Honey, new southern cuisine. It&#39;s made with a mix using roasted yellow tomatoes and garlic, Demitri&#39;s bloody seasoning, lemon juice and vodka OR moonshine! (go ahead, guess which we chose). Garnished with lemon, lime, pickled okra, a PIMENTO CHEESE stuffed olive, grilled SHRIMP, BACON, but not just any bacon baby, MAPLE PEPPER BACON, celery, asparagus, and a pickled jalapeno! We think an amen is in order.<br><br>20 ounces of awesome. The perfect drink for kicking back on the porch, enjoying a nice southern breeze on a warm summer day.\"\n",

I know people online rave about this dish, but for me it was overly sweet and in need of salt. Admittedly, I am not huge fan of honey, so that arguably greatly influenced my perception of this dish. The atmosphere inside the restaurant is beautiful, however, and the service was excellent. I&#39;ll definitely go back and try another dish.\"\n",

Well wish we didn&#39;t our experience was not good at all. Ordered pimento cheese nacho and replaced the chorizo with soysage. When we received dish it looked like real meat so I mentioned it to server she said she would check with chef not to mention took about 20+ mins to receive them. No one ever came back for about 5 more mins and it was the manager who said &#34;that was soysauge and that they are making us new ones and he will take care of it&#34; he walked away and I said to my husband if that was the case why didn&#39;t they just tell us that and give them back to us???????????<br>Waited another 15 mins and no nachos or waitress finally we grabbed someone and said don&#39;t worry about it we will just pay for our drinks we didn&#39;t have time to wait any longer. We were ignored again and about 10 more mins then they finally came out and they handed check to us with nachos in to go containers that took 30-40 mins to get! Need to say we left the nachos there and left the correct amount of our drinks and got into our Uber and left. Uber Plus Nachos<br>Moral of story you may not want to drop in quickly and have a beer and appetizer at bar if you have only 45 mins to spare!<br>Friendly Reminder: Nachos are chips with cold ingredients added to them topped with cheese and put in oven to melt for no more than 5 mins.\n",

            "ps0Y_WkkywSIQAzTszzGOQ,\"New menu, new chef but not for the better. Tupelo took out some of the better options on the menu for brunch. It seems that they are trying to reduce costs which was noticeable when we each got our biscuits and one tiny side of jam to split between the five of us. No knives, ketchup, or honey on the table anymore, those need to be requested separately which was hard to do since the server was busy for Sunday brunch. I normally eat my whole plate and if I don&#39;t, I will box it up to eat later. This was not the case with the Gulf Coast Lump Crab Benedict with potatoes. There was hardly any crab, the yolks of the poached eggs were hard and overcooked, the hollandaise sauce lacked flavor, the biscuit was mushy, and the potatoes burnt. My plate was basically untouched. When the server asked if I wanted a box I said no with a disgusted face. She took my full plate away and didn&#39;t offer to comp it. She never came back to check to see if our food was okay or fill up on water. I am very disappointed with Tupelo as I think it&#39;s a cool atmosphere and the food was one time pretty good.\"\n",

My Hog Heaven sandwich was good, although not what I was expecting. It did not come with the BBQ sauce as listed on the menu, but Heather quickly brought me some when I mentioned it.

The restaurant is very busy which made it hard for us to make it in. However, we decided to take a chance at brunch. Best decision!<br><br>Our wait was no more than 20 min which was understandable. The waiting area is really spacious and comfy. It was a but hectic with a toddler but it helped the waiting area was spacious. <br><br>Now let&#39;s dive into the good stuff and that is the food. <br><br>We started everything with biscuits and homemade berry jam. Now, these biscuits were heavenly, fluffy and just the right amount of flavor. The jam was another game winner. <br>We proceeded to order fried okra as an appetizer which was a winner. The okra was fresh and crispy with a nice amount of breading. At this point, we were slowing entering food coma. <br><br>Our entrees consisted of eggs &amp; steak with oven baked potatoes. The steak was cooked perfectly and the potatoes with done just right. Now the real MVP was the sauce (not sure what it was made off). <br><br>My wife ordered the shrimp and grits with chorizo. Fair warning the chorizo is very spicy and a bit overwhelming. The shrimp and grits would have been amazing with out the chorizo. The grits were probably one of my favorite items in the menu. They were so creamy and just had a very good consistency. <br> <br>Our toddler ordered off the kids menu which was another well prepared dish (even though it was for a kid). At this point we were the surprise of quality of food. <br><br>Now, let&#39;s get to the service and overall experience. Our server and service was exceptional from the start to the end. Our server William did a great job interacting with the table even though he has like 4 other tables. Even though my beer never made it out on time but it was forgotten due to all the other positive experiences.\"\n",

Luckily, we got there during happy hour, so we could order small plates for $5-7. Although the waiter told us we couldn&#39;t, we ended up getting to. Score. Note: even though it says happy hour ends at 7, the drink specials are all day.<br><br>The mini veggie burger and french fries were delicious, minus the gross onion on the burger. The fried green tomatoes came on top of some sort of paste-like side which I absolutely couldn&#39;t stomach. I had high hopes for those tomatoes, but one of my friends ate them instead. <br><br>The cosmopolitan I ordered was yummy, although so much stronger the second time I could hardly drink it. Our waiter tried to carry too many things at once and ended up pouring a martini all over my friend before the glass shattered on the floor. Yikes. His knowledge of the menu was so unimpressive I had to ask if he was new. He wasn&#39;t.<br><br>The second time I came to Tupelo, I took a drink suggestion from our waiter... big mistake. He told me his favorite drink, the blueberry mule, and insisted I&#39;d like it. So wrong! I was sick after one sip. It tasted like a frat guy had made it, not a bartender. He did not treat me very nicely after I told him I did not like the drink and asked for another one. In fact, he never came back to our table after that comment. Another waitress cashed us out, who said, &#34;happy now??&#34; once she got our checks right after mixing them up and having to reprint them with the correct orders. Didn&#39;t appreciate the &#39;tude.<br><br>The service was incredibly slow both times I have eaten here. I had to flag someone down for more water at least 3 times. Which is mind boggling because there were barely any other patrons eating at the time. The staff is rarely ever friendly or knowledgeable, which is kind of a not-so-cool thing at a restaurant.<br><br>Hire some new staff, make sure they study the menu, and check on that bartender...\"\n",

The biscuits are also warm, fluffy, and fresh out of the oven. That being said, they tend to over cook their eggs. If you specify that you want a runny yolk, it&#39;ll be runny but a poached or Sunny side up egg will definitely come out cooked all the way through! Otherwise food was good. It was an all around lovely experience.\"\n",

Another person in our group had the beef burger, again just far too greasy. Then last person had avocado toast and one poached egg was great, the other Boiled and no good.

Enough food to feed two people. The pancakes were delicious. The bacon was good but I thought it was slightly over cooked. I know that some people do like their bacon slightly burnt and super crispy. My girlfriend ordered the pork belly hash which was a bit disappointing as there was not much pork belly in it. I did enjoy the potatoes in the hash which was very tasty.

We pulled up exactly at 12:30pm for lunch, and they were calling him letting us know our table was ready. Perfect! <br>Our waiter was very friendly. He was able to accommodate our group of 6 just fine. A few of us ordered mimosas and bloody Marys. Despite how busy the restaurant was, they came out within a few minutes. Those were delicious! (Though, I could just be saying that because I was dining with my parents and they were causing us to drink!) <br>A few minutes later, their signature biscuits came out, with the homemade blackberry jam. The jam isn&#39;t too tart, and I love how you can still see the little pieces of berry when you got to spread it on your hot, fluffy biscuit. <br>For my main course, I ordered the fried chicken BLT. The chicken was perfectly fried. Nice and crispy, with juicy white tender meat inside. The bacon was also crispy-a must with a BLT. My side idea was a small salad, which actually wasn&#39;t small at all. It was a good bowlful. The salad contained spring greens, carrots, cherry tomatoes, and pine nuts. I ordered the avocado vinaigrette, which was really good. You should definitely come visit Tupelo Honey!\"\n",

            "TWQ4bxTnfz40cZMFCE2W-g,\"I have been wanting to try this place for a long time. Finally the chance came when my friend wanted brunch and I couldn&#39;t figure out a good place to go that was open before 11:30. The restaurant is definitely cute in terms of decor and feeling welcoming, but the positives of the vibes probably end there. To be fair, we sat inside - not that the hostess even bothered to ask about a preference, but sitting outside could have a nicer ambiance than what I experienced today. <br><br>The hostess politely tried to sit us at a very small table at the back of the restaurant. Upon seeing the size of the table, I felt like the plates would be too crowded with drinks and such and requests a larger table as there were 10-15 empty tables. The hostess cops an attitude and walks about to the front to &#39;check to see if she could do it&#39;. I sheepishly follow her like a lost puppy dog that just got berated for chewing up a shoe. She then takes my friend and I back to the back of the restaurant by the kitchen/washroom door and seats us. Really? All the empty tables and you put us in the back by the kitchen? Honestly the table she sat us at probably shouldn&#39;t even be there as the whole time my dining partner was constantly hit/bumped by servers trying to pass through with food/dishes. At one point a waiter actually asked him to move so he could get by. I&#39;m sorry if there isn&#39;t room for a customer to sit at this table without being told to move by waitstaff while sitting normally...then that is a good clue the table shouldn&#39;t be in that location. Honestly a very awkward and awful experience and that isn&#39;t even including the innumerable amount of times I heard distressing loud noises bellowing from the dishwashing area...not what I expect in terms of ambiance when I am paying ~ $20/entree. <br><br>Despite the seating issue and the attitude of the hostess the food was amazing! Biscuits were very well balanced with the salt and pepper standing up to the blueberry jam. Ordered the Omelets with pimento cheese, green tomatoes, bacon, and ham. Seriously one of the best omelets I have ever had. <br><br>Worth a visit for the high quality ingredients and great tasting food, just be firm about being seated in an area where you won&#39;t be treated as a nuisance by staff.\"\n",

He did enjoy his chicken, but was not impressed with  the sides. His words were &#34;KFC does slaw and mac and cheese better&#34;.

            "n4tD6axYRFajkX2ESvukMw,\"For the prices and the cuisine&#39;s potential, I should be able to give TH 4 to 5 stars, but instead I&#39;m giving a 2.5. We&#39;ve been to TH 2x now, once for dinner and once for brunch and both times they&#39;ve missed the mark. <br><br>First off I&#39;d like to say that the ambiance is charming and the waitstaff are generally friendly. It is absolutely a comfortable place to dine. Conceptually, TH is right up our alley; creative dishes, locally sourced ingredients...a nice twist on low country cuisine. They use fresh ingredients of good quality. However, someone in the kitchen is not consistently executing the recipes well at all.<br><br>Some items are reliably good, like the buttery biscuits. And sometimes the quality of the paired ingredients makes up for the fact that they&#39;re paired in a heavy handed way but a chef of questionable skill level, but only sometimes.<br><br>At our dinner, we had a fish entree that was fantastic in terms of freshness of the meat (tasted clean, pleasing...not fishy) but we had to send our salad back as the greens were actually dripping (and wilted by) an obscene amount of really strong sour tasting dressing. It was odd, as if a 5 year old had dressed our salad.<br><br>Our other entree and sides were memorable only for their saltiness. The small plates were good.<br><br>For our brunch, we had a couple nice appetizers/small plates (cinnamon bun - again, TH seems to do better with baked goods) and a couple disappointing entrees. The giant grit caked topped with salmon was good (ingredient-wise) but there were some serious flaws in construction. If you&#39;re going to top anything with a large quantity of smoked salmon like that you&#39;ve got to make sure the salmon is not 50% gristle. The act of having to forcefully yank what appear to be tendons out of the meat in my entree does nothing good for my appetite. There&#39;s an art to cutting meat and fish; true chefs know how to cut along the grain and remove less desirable parts (tendons, veins, other connective tissues/fascia, excessive amnts. of fat, and so on). Plus, with that much salmon and grit cake you&#39;ve got to give more than a teaspoon&#39;s worth of sour cream/creme fraiche and a couple slivers of julienned onions. I wasn&#39;t thrilled with the fact that I had to request more sour cream and then was charged for it. The recipe was not executed correctly...don&#39;t punish the diner :/<br><br>Our eggs and pork belly were not good at all...there wasn&#39;t much pork (about 6 pieces, each less than 1&#34; x 1&#34;). The pork, onion, and potatoes were all fried in the same pan rendering the dish homogeneous in taste and appearance and very oily. <br><br>In sum, for the price I&#39;m not in any hurry to go back to TH. I want every single thing I order to be done correctly. I think this place would be great if they hired a new head chef and took a close look at some of the prep cooks/sous chefs. Keep the menu as is. Keep getting the ingredients from the same resources. Just get a new chef - one who can execute these dishes properly.<br><br>Until that change occurs, go to TH for their baked goods, small plates, and drinks.\"\n",

Sweet tea was very yummy. Fried green tomatoes were VERY filling. Would come back for those and a cocktail, which would be plenty enough to fill your belly up. I got the shrimp and grits with chorizo for my lunch. I could only manage to eat a few bites since the app filled me so much. However , those few bites were absolutely delicious. Mouth watering worthy shrimp and grits. On the other hand, the fried chicken was not anything special. That&#39;s the reasoning for only 4 stars. Coating was pretty bland and chicken dry. The &#34;pork belly&#34; collard greens were more of just collards with no pork belly. Seriously didn&#39;t find a single piece in it. Boyfriend was disappointed, but he enjoyed the Mac and cheese. Definitely had lots of cheese in it. The waitress even made him some honey mustard which he loved. Props for that!

I was a bit underwhelmed in general by the food scene in Charlotte, but this was my first stop after hitting the city and I&#39;m glad I stayed.<br><br>Food: I had the Shoo Mercy Pancake and I was so happy with it. That sweet potato pancake was perfectly sweet and a little bit savory. The fried chicken on top and peppered bacon simply took the dish over the top. I ate just about ALL of it. It was delicious, The only thing that I did not care for were the pecans sprinkled on top of the dish, as I am not too fond of nuts on top of or baked into my food. Luckily, they were whole nuts so I was easily able to chuck them off of the plate and dive in. I also ordered the mega-mosa mimosa, it was nice and strong. They have two mimosa options, a regular sized one in a wine glass for $8, and the mega one in a regular draft glass for like $9..do yourself a favor and get the mega size. It is virtually ALL sparkling wine! Yessss! As if I wasnt stuffed enough from the pancake I could not leave this place without also trying on the complimentary hot biscuits w/blueberry jam. Great biscuit!..Not too doughy, &amp; with just enough crunch on the outside. <br><br>Service: Not too shabby. I went alone on a busy Saturday morning and was finally able to weasel my self onto a bar stool to sit after about 20 mins of waiting on the porch outside. I put my name down for a table initially, but was told by the hostess that the bar area seating is first come, first serve, so if I found a seat there before my table was ready, by all means take it. That&#39;s exactly what I did. The bartenders were quick and attentive given the volume of orders they had coming in. I was pleased. My food took only 10 mins to arrive after ordering it. That was impressive given the amount of people in the place.<br><br>Atmosphere: Nice decor, but honestly I was just there for the FOOD! :)<br><br>Brunch is BUSY here and parking is a bit of a nightmare. There is a lot that the restaursnt shares with the other businesses and it fills quickly. I had to stalk someone for my spot! That is probably the only thing that would deter me from returning frequently. Yet and still, I will certainly be back.\"\n",

            "dXCcQD7RyStWmmG-8hkiPA,\"I was looking forward to trying out this restaurant since I really love the one in Myrtle Beach. Unfortunately, it was a big disappointment.  They are all a little different. <br><br>The service was confusing. We weren&#39;t exactly sure who our waiter or waitress was. The first girl that came to the table said she&#39;d help us. Then another guy came out and said he would. It was like they were taking turns. <br><br>The food really wasn&#39;t that great either. I had the Skirt Steak, Potato Cracklins, and Green Tomato Chow Chow. The steak wasn&#39;t cooked properly. It was way over done. The Potato Cracklings were a disappointment and so was the Green Tomato Chow Chow. <br><br>My companion had ordered the Meatloaf. It was completely burned on the bottom... Actually it was black. <br><br>The manager did deduct some money off of the bill which was nice. I appreciated that. <br><br>Atmosphere is nice, but I doubt we will be back to this particular location.\"\n",

They kick my grandma&#39;s biscuit&#39;s outta the water (sorry, Grandma, but you need to step your game up!)<br><br>Top picks:<br>If you have never tried chicken &amp; pancakes, or if you love it: their&#39;s are top notch. If you are really up for a challenge, try eating the entire meal... I don&#39;t think it can be done. The Shoo Mercy Pancake consists of 2 heaping flapjacks topped with  buttermilk fried chicken, maple-peppered bacon and 100% maple syrup. <br><br>I also am a big fan of the Tupelo Farm Fresh Cheeseburger consisting of pasture-raised Black Angus beef served with aged Wisconsin cheddar, lettuce, onions, house-made pickles and Chef Brian&#39;s special sauce. I like to accompany my burger with shaved brussels sprouts salad<br>with honey vinaigrette and baked mac &#39;n cheese. <br><br>Also, be sure to sign up for their email club and get a Tupelo Honey pint glass!\"\n",

I went it during my lunch break all to wait for 45 minutes for my grilled cheese and salad for the Chef to come out and tell me the kitchen burned it.. while I respect the Chefs approach, this could&#39;ve been disclosed to us when it happened, not 45 minutes later into waiting, only after me asking for a manager because no one had approached the table. When I finally did get my food, 54 minutes later, it was barely luke warm and my &#34;grilled cheese&#34; had ONE piece of cheese and overly dry/toasted bread. I came in with only one other person and so excited for a good lunch and break from work and left with an empty stomach and bad taste of dry bread. <br>From the sound of the tables around me today, they weren&#39;t very pleased either.  <br>For the biscuits sake, please get better on the rest of your menu!

Our server was new, so he wasn&#39;t able to answer my questions about the different menu items. Le sigh.  We finally ordered. I ordered the Shoo Mercy sweet potato pancakes. The presentation was nice but I took a bite and noticed a weird aftertaste. The pancakes were burnt as hell. The server was confused while trying to explain they were supposed to be black as coal. Umm, nope. My eating partner had the same kind of pancakes and hers were a normal color. I ordered the fried tomatoes instead.

For example the pecan pie French toast was $14 and it was literally three slices of bread layered with a smushed piece of pie...very underwhelming.

My two friends and I were having a really hard time deciding on what to get so we decided to split three items. We split the Blueberry Pain Perdu, Famous Sweet Potato Pancake, and the Genuine Country Breakfast with over-easy eggs sausage, and potato cracklins. <br><br>The Blueberry Pain is sweet. I definitely could not have eaten a full plate of them, but as a portion of my breakfast it was perfect. The Sweet Potato pancake was also delicious. It actually inspired me to look up sweet potato pancake recipes when i got home. Basically i want to have this for breakfast every day.

            "JY_--xgbF2WYzGywcFKf0A,\"I have been putting off reviewing Tupelo for a while now because I have very mixed feelings towards it. My first experience here was awesome! I got the breakfast bowl I think it&#39;s called and it was delicious! It had so many different flavor a that blended so well together! I couldn&#39;t wait to go back and I did a few weeks later for brunch again and got the same thing! Again delicious. <br><br>A few months later I moved closer to Tupelo and I was so excited! I went back a few more times and again, everything was delicious. The service was great and everyone was always nice. I decided that I liked the food and atmosphere so much that I was going to apply for a job, if only I knew what a headache this would be. <br><br>I applied and got hired on the spot. I was told ode hear from the manager about orientation by a certain date, didn&#39;t hear so I had to call. So I showed up for orientation, it was typical what I expected. Then I had my first training shift all set up. I showed up and the restaurant was closed? I almost turned around and left until I saw someone I knew from orientation. She informed me that they closed to retrain everyone....okay. So I went up expecting to be on the floor training and what I got instead was a 5 hour orientation. Had I known about this, maybe I wouldn&#39;t have been so annoyed. No email, no phone call, nothing. The response when I asked- oh I thought you got an email. So I let it go, went through the 5 hour orientation that was paid-plus. Then again had to sign up for my first training on the floor. Apparently they had no openings? Which I don&#39;t get, I&#39;ve worked in the restaurant business for a long time and usually you just match a trainee up with someone working. So again I was told they would contact me, I double checked they had my contact information, they did....but again I was not contacted. So at this point I went through 2 orientations and not being contacted 3 times after being hired. I didn&#39;t even bother at this point, I found another job that cared about its new employee it hired.<br><br>With all that said, my view of Tupelo has changed. I was less than pleased. It was so unorganized and unprofessional of a business and I could not believe it! Not to mention I did not get paid for my time that I gave up to be at orientation. I&#39;ve been back once because my friend begged to go there but otherwise I will not be returning. I tasted a lot of the food during orientation and the several times I&#39;ve been there and it&#39;s not that great, a lot is pretty typical and not very &#34;farm to table&#34; like it&#39;s said to be. And the last time I was there, the servers were all over the place and having private conversations right in front of our table, again unprofessional. <br><br>Usually I hate giving bad reviews but I felt it necessary for what I experienced here.\"\n",

For some reason this dish was screaming at me. I am really not that much of a fan of the tomato soup thing, but it goes with grilled cheese so well.  <br><br>G ordered the hamburger (well done) with the side of mac n cheese. <br><br>While we were waiting for our order, they brought out what could have been the star of the show. The amazing drop biscuit. This is not your cookie cutter biscuit. Its buttery, cheesy, a little salty, with just a hint of rosemary. Oh I want to jump in a tub of these delicious bundles of heavenliness.  They also bring you the honey and that jam, damn the jam....why are you so good. You just know they have some grandma&#39;s in the back making this jam. It taste just like homemade jam. Did I mention the jam???  <br><br>Ok, now back to the food.  It did seem that the food did take a bit longer than what I would have expected to arrive. The restaurant was not extremely busy, so it seemed odd. We were in no rush, except for the food, and since we have no issues with conversation it was all good. While waiting I ordered the blueberry punch. It was so refreshing and tasted like it could have been an beverage that would have been a great mix of flavors to go with vodka. I&#39;m so old that I remember when vodka did not come in flavors. It was just vodka. You had to flavor it yourself. <br><br>The meal came and the presentation was really nice.  G bit into his hamburger immediately and said it was great. I did try a bite and I agreed, even though it was well done, they somehow were able to keep it juicy. He also had the side of Mac n Cheese and this is where momma&#39;s Mac n Cheese goes rogue. This side had some kick. It was pumped up with peppery goodness.<br>The only thing this side was missing was the crusty cheesy top that you usually get when you order Mac n Cheese. This side was definitely a new twist on an old favorite. There was also a side salad which was very fresh and colorful. It was topped with sunflower seeds and two of their dressing to try. Next was to dig into my amped up grilled cheese sandwich. The bread was hot and toasty and buttery. The hot inside Havarti and Pimento Cheese was oozing out, a cheesy perfection of a sandwich. I was trying to figure out how to duplicate this at home. Now the tomato soup. It was creamy, but not your typical Campbells retro creamy stuff. This soup had little bits and pieces of tomato in the soup. The soup was hot and amazing and wait, I don&#39;t even like tomato soup but this was so good. They give you such a large bowl there is no finishing the soup unless your just ravenous. I did find room for all of the sandwich. Not a crumb left on the plate.<br><br>I would be giving this visit 5 stars, but the wait time for the food was a bit on the lengthy side.<br>Did I mention the biscuit and jam? Just go for drinks and biscuits and life will be perfect, or at least seem that way.\"\n",

This dish is not overly sweet; it was a great balance of sweet and salty. <br><br>My Husband had the Fried Chicken with the brussel sprouts and fried okra. You can choose your own sides and they have yummy selections. It was two pieces of boneless fried chicken breast with yummy gravy over it. The Biscuit that comes out before your meal with the blueberry perseve is delicious.

Once we were seated our table was wet and covered in cleaner, and our menus were soaking wet as well. We didn&#39;t even receive silverware. <br><br>Waitress came over and and got a drink order, looked at our wet table and just left. Came over and dropped of the drinks and looked at us like we&#39;re crazy because we had to dry off our table and menus ourselves. When she looked us as like we were crazy we said it was because the table was covered in cleaner and our menus were wet and she said he just cleaned the table and then left. She didn&#39;t offer to get us napkins or even dry the table off. <br><br>After she dropped off our drinks we noticed our glasses were dirty, both had frosting or cream of some sort all over them. When she came back about 5 mins later with the biscuits we had to ask her for new drinks and showed her the dirty ones and she acted as if it wasn&#39;t her problem. Once she returned with the new drinks it wasn&#39;t what we ordered and we also had to ask her for silverware. <br><br>So as you can imagine our experience was not good to start and keeps getting worse. Our waitress acted like the issues we&#39;ve had: wet table and menus, dirty glasses, no silverware, ect were a severe inconvenience to her. That being said: she decided to ignore our table from the time she brought our replacement drinks to after we were done eating. She served the tables around us but blatantly ignored us. <br><br>We finished our food, which was pretty good, and she walked past our table on 4 occasions with our napkins and silverware on the plates on the edge of the table and wouldn&#39;t pick them up. It wasn&#39;t until the table behind us was ready to cash out she brought us checks. Once she got our card she went and rang out every other table she had before giving us back our check. <br><br>I&#39;ve been here and had really good food and service but this waitress with the pink hair made what could have been a really pleasant experience absolutely awful.

It can get a little pricey depending on what you order, but it&#39;s totally worth it in my opinion. <br><br>I also really like the atmosphere, it&#39;s big and has a open vault ceiling so you get lots of light inside.

That just isn&#39;t the case ... Maybe I need to try Tupelo for brunch to get the food experience I&#39;ve been hoping for. <br><br>I&#39;ll start out by saying the food was good ... I just feel that if I&#39;m paying close to $20 for an entree, I want SOMETHING about the meal to pop and make me feel that it&#39;s worth my hard-earned dolla-dolla bills y&#39;all. . If anything, I&#39;d say the damn biscuit was my favorite part of the whole meal (they&#39;re that good). The nutty fried chicken was very moist, and you definitely get the pine nut taste from the crust. The gravy with it was just so-so, nothing special in my book. The shoestring fries with parmesan &amp; bbq spice sound wayyyyyyyyy better than they actually are.  They ended up being nothing special, just your average fry with a little dusting of seasoning, I actually feel like I wasted a side dish getting the fries. I&#39;d recommend trying something [anything] else. The mac n&#39;cheese ... now that was pretty damn good. It was a tad spicy, maybe from pimento? Definitely pick this as a side no matter what. <br><br>I was able to try bites from my wife&#39;s meal: grilled Atlantic salmon with a maple butter glaze served with sides of pine nut edamame salad and cheesy smashed cauliflower. The salmon had a great flavor --- you could definitely taste the maple flavor on the crust. The edamame salad is almost kind of Thai/Asian flavored ... so it&#39;s definitely not a good pairing with a traditional southern meal, in my opinion. I though the smashed cauliflower was going to be basically like mashed potatoes, as I&#39;ve had it other places ... and this was not the case. It was big pieces and that were semi broken into smaller pieces, but definitely not &#34;smashed&#34; as you would think. Nothing special in the flavoring of it either, just a cheesy sauce. <br><br>The service here was awesome, our waitress checked back often about refills on drinks, how everything tasted, and if we needed anything else. I would definitely give her a solid 5 stars. She also had her recommendations down pat from every section of the menu if you were unsure of what to go with. I&#39;m looking forward to going back from brunch and hopefully really finding out what all the hype around this place is truly about.\"\n",

Get it and you won&#39;t be disappointed in the cheese. Also my favorite cheese of all time and that&#39;s really saying something with all the options!!

The best way to get there is by Light Rail, if you can get on the Lynx and take it to the South End of Charlotte. It is right off of the stop! You wont be able to miss it because the smell of yummy food immediately hits you when you get off the train. I have now been their two times, one time for brunch and one time to dinner. a majority of the pictures are from their dinner. During every meal they give you homemade biscuits, Tupelo honey, and their homemade blueberry jam. The Ribs and the Corn Souffle are probably by far the best! The meat was so tinder that it just fell off the bone. The Corn Souffle melted in your mouth. They put their Mac and Cheese in a tiny skillet, I LOVE this because it keeps it warm while you eat. I also 100% suggest anything with their fried chicken. The chicken is so tinder and delicious. Be prepared to eat a lot... But I guarantee you won&#39;t leave unhappy!\"\n",

The interior is a mix of industrial and rustic with lots of wood, exposed brick walls, and high ceilings.<br><br>Dora here. Don&#39;t you just love the interior? This is my kinda place. Parking around noon on Saturday was non-existent in the lot behind the restaurant, but no worries. There&#39;s free on-street parking on the other side of the light rail. Also, the 35-minute wait only ended up being 15 minutes. Another score!<br><br>Rather than table bread, Tupelo serves scratch-made biscuits with blueberry jam. These biscuits were great, crispy and buttery and warm, and the blueberry jam was the perfect pairing. We would have preferred to eat ours prior to the meal, but with a packed dining room, they came out with our meal. Dora here. I don&#39;t care what time they got to the table. I could&#39;ve stuffed myself with these biscuits! The food did seem to take awhile, but service was very attentive and gracious.<br><br>I chose the Tupelo Farm Fresh Burger with cheddar cheese, lettuce, house-made pickles and a secret sauce along with fried okra and tomatoes. The burger was outstanding, grilled perfectly, tasty, and the secret sauce brought it all together. The okra and tomatoes were fresh, lightly battered with just the right amount of crunch. <br><br>Dora here. So many choices! But I finally decided on the Charleston Chicken Sandwich, a marinated grilled chicken breast with lettuce, Havarti cheese on sourdough wheat bread with a side of mac-n-cheese. Doesn&#39;t that sound great? The chicken was oh-so-tender and juicy, and I really liked the cranberry flavored mayo. First time eating sourdough wheat bread, and I liked it. The mac-n-cheese was creamy with just the right amount of firmness and kick. <br><br>I would rate this restaurant 5 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving outstanding food. Definitely worth a return visit!<br>Ernie &amp; Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith &amp; Foodies Blog\"\n",

            "Af0-vJrHIx2agB5Zzv8idA,\"I just don&#39;t get the hype or the long brunch wait time.  Why is everybody clamoring to eat here?  I have a lifelong love affair with brunch and to top it with outdoor patio dining is dropping a cherry on my brunch sundae.  But both times that I&#39;ve been to Tupelo have left me wishing that I had that egg McMuffin, breakfast burrito and Krispy Kreme glazed donut (my on the fly, tried-and-true backup weekend sweet and savory breakfast) instead.  Tupelo gets 2.5 stars but I&#39;m rounding down because I&#39;m literally stunned by the 4-star rating for: (1) fabulous ambience (4.5 stars); (2) long wait time (2 stars); (3) better than average service (3.5 stars); and (4) REALLY heavy, greasy, bland food (2 stars).<br><br>_____Fabulous ambience.  Tupelo feels like how I would imagine it would be to visit a Southern aunt or grandmother who baked pies, fried everything that you could imagine, and when she wasn&#39;t baking, she was making quilts; it&#39;s rustic and meant to feel welcoming and cozy.  The patio is enclosed and tucked away behind some mature trees to facilitate your immersion into its Southern charm.  <br><br>_____Dreadful wait time.  You can&#39;t book a reservation on Open Table until 12:30 and let&#39;s be honest, by then that&#39;s not brunch, that&#39;s just plain old lunch.  It is noteworthy to mention that they can&#39;t serve alcohol until noon, on the dot.  To their credit, the wait does move along pretty quickly and they overestimate the wait time so that you&#39;re pleasantly surprised when your name gets called ahead of schedule.<br><br>_____Better than average service.  Our server was upbeat, super friendly and attentive.  However, his recommendations weren&#39;t very good (see below); when we asked for extra mustard (our chicken BLT was very bland), it didn&#39;t come until AFTER our meal was almost over; and when we told him that the best thing we had on the menu was our pineapple tiki drink, as he cleared away our nearly full plates after we declined to go boxes, he didn&#39;t give the 5-star Yelp spiel that we overheard him giving to all the other patrons (in fact, he didn&#39;t mention Yelp at all) and didn&#39;t really do anything or offer any conciliatory gesture or at least communicate our discontent to a manager.<br><br>______REALLY heavy, greasy, bland food.  Tupelo is southern cooking with an unexpected twist but its delivery leaves you wanting more flavor, less charring.  I&#39;ve been twice and both times I was wishing I had that egg McMuffin or Krispy Kreme donut instead.  I&#39;ve had:<br><br>GOOD:<br>++++++pineapple tiki drink: It&#39;s $23 and meant for 2 and pretty heavy on the alcohol.  It&#39;s delicious and refreshing but wish they would have given me the pineapple that was cored out to enjoy.<br>++++++Bloody Mary: the vodka pour is pretty heavy handed; this is a hearty drink and very flavorful.<br>++++++complimentary biscuits:  the biscuits are served warm with raspberry jam and honey.  They&#39;re sweet and fluffy, especially with the jam and honey but I wouldn&#39;t say they are better than Red Lobster&#39;s biscuits.<br>MEH:<br>--------fried chicken BLT.  The chicken was dry yet greasy and bland but overall, the dish was edible.<br>--------beet salad.  The sweet, tangy dressing, cheese and candied nuts are a nice touch to the salad.<br>--------signature salad.  Wish there were more apples because the greens are a little bitter; the sweet vinaigrette goes nicely with the tartness of the apples.  The croutons are made of corn bread so they&#39;re a little sweet. <br>--------Eggs Betty.  The hollandaise sauce was pretty bland but is better after salt is added.<br>--------shrimp and grits. Tried this because it&#39;s a signature southern dish but it was underwhelming and bland.  The shrimp was chewy and rubbery; the sauce was spicy but otherwise not very flavorful.<br>AVOID:<br>--------Appalachian shrimp: the shrimps are supposed to be infused in sweet, semi spicy chili sauce dressed on corn soufflé.  Everything tasted charred and the corn soufflé was just soggy corn bread.<br>--------okra.  The okra was charred and very greasy.  The buttermilk dipping sauce isn&#39;t as salty and flavorful as Ranch dressing, which would have tasted better.<br>--------Brussel sprouts.  Charred, super dry, bland and very greasy.<br>--------mac and cheese.  Dry and not cheesy at all.  <br><br>Overall, every time I have been here, I am remorseful for the money I spend eating here (which is usually around $65 for 2 people, before 20% gratuity) because I could have my egg McMuffin and Krispy Kreme for less than $10.  I don&#39;t mind shelling out that amount if the experience is better than McDonald&#39;s and Krispy Kreme, but sadly, it is not.\"\n",

They did a great job with the reservation and the people we&#39;re pleasant but that&#39;s about the end of it.<br><br>We were very disappointed in every other aspect of our long journey.

While we were seated on time, once we ordered our meal it took over an hour to actually get the food. I understand being busy but an hour for our order is ridiculous. Meanwhile the AC was freezing us out, but we had plenty of time to go outside and thaw, despite our several requests to turn the AC back. Once the food did arrive there were a several misses from what was ordered but after waiting an hour we ate what we could and got out if there.

I moved to Charlotte this week and woke up excited for my first weekend brunch #basic. I had been to Tupelo honey in Asheville a few years ago and remembered LOVING it. Sadly, this experience left me disappointed and I will definitely not go back. We got there at 9am and we were sat next to the kitchen/servers station. While I understand you have to make the most of your space, this was literally the worst seat in the house and no reason to seat us there with a third of the seats being empty. Moving onto the food....the javos rancheros was cold and unappetizing. The whole restaurant had a sterile and corporate feel. Nothing like what I experienced in Asheville. To put the final nail in the coffin, the server dropped the check off MINUTES after we received our food with plates and drinks barely touched. Poor form.

So I decided on the Famous Fried Green Tomatoes/Fried Okra/Crispy Brussels Sprouts. The Famous Fried Green Tomatoes are served over goat cheese grits and red pepper coulis. I didn&#39;t know what coulis was until I Googled it. Coulis is a thick sauce made from puréed and strained vegetables or fruits. The tomatoes was cooked to perfection (golden brown) and the dish was finished with fresh basil. Whoever thought about goat cheese in grits is heaven sent. This place makes me look at goat cheese differently. Probably the best fried green tomatoes I&#39;ve ever had. The fried okra was great as well. This was served with a with sauce that gave me ranch vibes. The Crispy Brussels Sprout was served with fresh herbs and lemon zest and a tangy ranch. Overall experience was absolutely great.

This was my first time here and the biscuits lived up to the descriptions I&#39;ve heard.

I had that cocktail of the day as well as the sangria. Both solid strong drinks. One of the guys had to get their award winning bloody mary. Not only was it visually stunning, it tasted amazing with just the right amount of spice. For appetizers we indulged in the fried green tomatoes, cauliflower, brussel sprouts, &amp; pickles. The batter on the cauliflower was delish and we all decided that we would return just for the brussel sprouts alone. Food euphoria!! Definitely did not disappoint! Quite a few of us had the variations of shrimp and grits and we were all pleased. The best part of our experience was the very welcoming staff. Our waitress went above and beyond to ensure that our visit was memorable. She even went as far as offering to mail me a pint glass because they were out of stock.

The fried okra was seasoned very well.  The mimosa could have used a little more orange juice to sweeten it but it was enjoyable.

She either didn&#39;t do anything or didn&#39;t have the resources to do so. From then on the experience got worse. Many of the items people ordered weren&#39;t available, particularly the vegetables which makes vegetarian dining difficult. The service continued to be slow and felt inhospitable. We made this reservation well in advance. Your team should have been proactive about staffing for a large group and making sure we were well taken care of. In reality you let one server struggle to take care of our table while also tending the bar and serving other tables.

She has been here a few times now and swore I would love it here and she was right, I did! I ordered the banana pudding pancakes and she ordered the eggs Betty. There were a couple items on the menu I was thinking of ordering but I&#39;m so glad I went with these pancakes! For those with a sweet tooth, these pancakes are for you! They were covered in pudding, bananas, and a very sweet sugary rum sauce they called it. These pancakes were very filling and I could not finish them all even though I wanted to! The portions are huge! My friend did not finish all of her plate either. We also ordered a side of grits (they were awesome), and mimosas, which were also really decently sized! In my opinion, this place is a bit on the pricey side. However, the food is really good and the portions are huge so I&#39;d say it&#39;s worth it! <br><br>The atmosphere of this place was great. They had a few different seating areas inside, a bar, and outdoor seating. It was a pretty large space and the place was packed for their Saturday brunch time. We did not make a reservation and waited at the bar for maybe 10-15 minutes for a table to be ready. <br>Our waitress was super nice and helpful with the menu. The bathrooms were clean. And the decor in this place is awesome! It&#39;s got a trendy rustic vibe to it! <br><br>I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great brunch spot!\"\n",

Our server comes over to take our drink/appetizer order. She didn&#39;t seem warm at all, and didn&#39;t really know which drinks were being served from the menu. Also, when the waitress came back by to take our food order, after a few minutes she came back to say that what my wife ordered was not on the menu that night.. kind of disappointed. Towards the end of our meal I mentioned the email that we received for the free beer glass with the purchase of a signature drink and she said that they were low on glasses but would go check. She then brought back our check but did not tell us if there were any other glasses available. The reason why I am giving this a four star review is because of the hostess at the front and the manager that when asked about the glass gave us a business card to pick it up on another night. Our food was incredible, but the waitress that we had on Saturday wasn&#39;t that suggestive or happy.\"\n",

It took a long time to get our drinks and when we finally did, some were missing. To get this corrected took an extra 10-15 minutes. 2 of 7 food orders came out incorrect, and no one in my party was overly pleased with their meal, especially for the price.. Lastly, the bathrooms were disgusting. There was trash all over the floor of the womens room, and there was no toilet paper or paper towels available. They appeared to not have been cleaned in days. It seems that this restaurant is severely understaffed and the quality of service does not align with the prices you are paying for food. Parking is a nightmare as well. I will not rush back to eat here again and I think the 6 other women I went with would say the same.<br><br>Oh, and.. the hostesses were less than pleasant. There were a large number of customers waiting for a table with not much room to stand and wait. When trying to get past us we were given a rude &#34;excuse me&#34; in a snarky tone of voice - almost yelling, 3 different times in 5 minutes. I understand you are busy and perhaps we are in your way, but I don&#39;t think that is an appropriate way to address a customer who made a reservation days in advance and still had to wait 15 minutes for the table.\"\n",

Came to Tupelo Honey for a pre Panther&#39;s game brunch with 2 friends. We actually made a reservation on Open Table becuase we knew it would get packed quickly and it did. Btw if you didn&#39;t get the clue, you can make a reservation on Open Table. When we arrived, we were seated immediately. We ordered a round of mimosas and every single time I order a mimosa here, I forget that they use fresh orange juice and it has the pulp. I&#39;m not a fan of pulp but I drank it anyway. They brought us the delicious biscuits and I drizzled honey on mine. I ordered the BLT chicken sandwich with a side of the goat cheese grits. Their grits are so creamy and delicious with the goat cheese. The chicken sandwich is good. I subbed the dijon mustard for the cranberry bbq sauce. The sauce is a bit tart bc of the cranberries but I like it. I love Tupelo Honey and visit often.\"\n",

I&#39;ve always had great experiences at this location but this time, it wasn&#39;t that great due to the carelessness of our server.  My niece is 10, and has Celiac disease, so trying to find a place that has truly gluten free options can be limiting.  We specifically chose Tupelo, as they offered gluten free options.  Before we ordered, we explained that my niece had Celiac disease and needed a gluten free menu, our server explained that the regular menu called out the gluten free options available and no special menu was needed.  So far so good.  So, we all order our food, I got Shrimp and Grits, my husband and my niece ordered the Southern Omelette(labelled gluten free on the menu), and my sister ordered the Shoo mercy Omelette. We again made sure to state that the child&#39;s food needed to be gluten free.  After a reasonable amount of time my husband, my sister and my food was brought to the table.  This is not an unusual occurrence when dining out with my niece, as most places will take extra care to make sure that food going out to someone with Celiac is perfect. Just a few minutes later, our server comes out with an omelette and puts in front of my niece, and we confirm, again, that her food is gluten free.  The server confirms that it is, and leaves our table to let us enjoy our food.  So, as we all start eating, my niece pulls a piece of bacon out of her omelette and eats it, then sticks her fork in one of the items in her omelette and says &#34;What&#39;s this?&#34;.  Folks, it was a fried green tomato, covered in breading.  I&#39;m a little freaking out at this point, because she ate bacon off her omelette, and if it was touching the breading on the fired green tomato, she might have an autoimmune response later (basically, for those of you not in the know, she will have flu-like symptoms, including joint and body pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and spike a fever, not to mention permanent damage to her intestines).  I felt terrible, as the kid is visiting us on vacation and now, due to the carelessness of a server, she might spend one of those days feeling miserable. We call our server over and explain the situation and she just goes &#34;oh, let me check on that&#34; and leaves with the food.  She does come back with the correct omelette (we know, because the first thing we did was open it and make sure all the ingredients were correct) and then just leaves. I think the thing that most irks me is not once did we get an apology from the server for the error, in fact she seemed almost as if she couldn&#39;t care less.  I understand that people make mistakes, but we checked three times to make sure the kid wasn&#39;t gonna get glutened and only because the 10 year old was smart enough to question what was given to her did we avoid a miserable weekend for her. I will say, that I spoke to the manager on the way out and she was very apologetic and understood the severity of the situation.  This experience will not stop me from going to Tupelo Honey in the future, but I probably will be obnoxiously diligent when bringing folks with Celiac or any other type of food restriction.\"\n",

For my entree I ordered shoo mercy pancakes. I recommend them over everything else on that menu, and I haven&#39;t even tried anything else, except the macaroni n cheese, (which was good) and hush puppies (also good; they have a hint of lemon in them). What this is, is sweet potato pancakes, with slices of bacon, a piece of crispy fried chicken, candied pecans, and a pat of butter, all on top. (A cup of syrup comes on the plate too) On the side it comes with eggs cooked your way, &amp; some kind of baked apple. I ordered scrambled eggs with havarti cheese. It was great! As for my drink I ordered rosemary peach lemonade. Try it if you can. <br>All of their food is sourced locally as possible, so the menu is subject to change as our waiter said.\"\n",

You can taste the cheesy goodness in these grits....must be gruyere or goat cheese.....A must get!<br><br>Not being in a burger mood, I chose the fried pork tenderloin sandwhich covered with cheese and topped with a sriracha aioli, all over a green apple slice. Personally I don&#39;t think this sandwich needed the apple. Nonetheless this sandwich was OUTSTANDING! Just pick your diet relief day to come here....definitely not on the weight watchers approved list! Oh the dish normally comes with asparagus but I opted to substitute their awesome cheesy onion soup with bacon croutons....seriously?<br><br>Note: I heard that Management is going to take off this pork sandwich. Ask them for it and ask why they would take off a 5 star sandwich! I already provided my feedback. So it may not be on the menu when you come.....uggggg.<br><br>Finally I asked for them to bring out my biscuits at the end instead of as your traditional appetizer. These are always delicious! Love their homemade jam, but I really love the real Tupelo honey, ostensibly what the restaurant is named after.<br><br>A big shout out to Tiara! She was the awesome bartender who took care of me, and made me feel like part of the THC family.

For our meals were an order of sweet potato pancakes, it went half uneaten. An order of shrimp and grits, which my friend did not care for their grits. An flake steak, which was quite spicy from the peppers it was topped with. It was cooked well and had a good flavor. And lastly there was an order of ribs that came out burnt with sauce over the top. These were sent back and came back cooked better. Over all the table agreed the food was ok, but not good and not a place we would come back to. (At least not for dinner, maybe breakfast is better?) Also the food was over priced for what we got and how it tasted. The staff/servers were all quite nice and friendly. But over all we were disappointed with our experience here.\"\n",

I followed that with a flat iron steak/honey Brussels sprouts and hominy/fingerling potatoes. The horseradish is a VERY prominent flavor in this dish, maybe a little more than I wanted or needed.

We learned only after our meal arrived that you are supposed to get complementary biscuits and blueberry jam because they were not delivered until after our meals were delivered which took quite a while. I understand they were busy but I work in the service industry and a manager should have at least come by to speak with us. <br><br>We decided that maybe they had servers call in sick or quit and maybe were understaffed so we have them another try last week. Our server was much better this time around. We each drank the megamosa while we waited for a table with was really delicious. Our server was much better the second time around but the food was still slow to come out. I think they need to figure out how to speed things up in the kitchen and we again didn&#39;t see a manager.

Staff was was very friendly and accommodating. We got the complementary biscuits and in house made blueberry jam. The biscuit itself was delicious the blueberry jam was not our favorite but we are partial to strawberry. <br>We ordered the chicken and biscuits with an egg, the Shoo Mercy Pancakes and the southern breakfast bowl. The white gravy and biscuits had a great flavor with the basil. The fried chicken was over cooked making it dry and tough to chew. The chicken on my dads pancakes was the same and he did not eat but two bites of chicken. The massive sweet potato pancake was bursting with sweet sugary flavor. I would highly recommend the pancake with the side of bacon combo. My girlfriend&#39;s southern bowl was mediocre with eggs, black eye peas, bacon, grits and salsa verde with chorizo added to it. The bowl itself was watery maybe from thin grits and the salsa and the flavor seemed to be lacking. To be completely honest i generally like a more traditional breakfast style with meat eggs and a carb.

She walked off while my brother in law was mid sentence twice. My father in law asked for iced tea, she came back with a glass of ice and we didn&#39;t see her again for 10 minutes. Someone else brought our food by, and it was at least 10-15 minutes before she came to check on is. <br><br>We started with an order of the &#34;Southern Popcorn&#34; (fried okra) &amp; it was good. Too many little crumbly pieces of just fried dough, and not very many good pieces of okra, but the pieces we had were good. <br><br>The biscuits and blueberry jam were delicious. The biscuits were super moist, and I could have eaten about 10 of these.<br><br>I had the shrimp &amp; grits (shoo mercy style) and while the shrimp mixture was delicious, the grits were pretty bad. They were advertised as goat cheese grits and had zero flavor. They also weren&#39;t creamy at all and were just a congealed mass of flavorlessness.<br><br>Graham had the catfish and had the same issue with his grits: congealed with zero flavor. The salsa on top was also kind of odd. The catfish was spicy, so maybe it was supposed to calm it down, but it just didn&#39;t work well with it. A salsa with more flavor would have been much better.<br><br>We had a party of 8, and no one LOVED their dinner. However, the restaurant redeemed itself after the fact. I made a comment on twitter that dinner was disappointing and the GM reached out to me to make things right.

The bloody mary&#39;s for brunch are simply awesome...spice or not, depending on taste but always with a little okra to add a little southern flavor. The portions have always been good and food good tasting...from the chicken on down to everything else. The biscuits and honey they give you before dinner are also excellent, one of the better Southern touches the restaurant specializes in. I&#39;ve tried many things and have never had a bad meal. Service is usually awesome, parking can usually be found with a little searching their backlot but it&#39;s best to plan for a little wait time at brunch and dinner because sometimes the line can be long.

One of my favorite items of the night was, surprisingly, my mom&#39;s side of potato cracklins.

For some reason this South Charlotte location didn&#39;t send me home with the same feeling. The service was average at best (we sat in the bar, which was nearly empty) and the hostess was not friendly. She brought us into the bar and sat us at a table that needed to be wiped down. When we asked if someone could do so she seemed appalled we ask for such a thing to be done. Not the normal service their other locations pride themselves on. <br><br>Meanwhile, my food was pretty good. I had the BBQ pork, which was downed in sauce, The black eyed peas were awesome, but the mashed sweet potatoes were average. They looked like they came out of a ice cream scooper, much different than what I had at the other locations. My cousin had the shrimp and grits. They were presented well, but tasted average, she said. <br><br>Still I believe Tupelo is a great place for lunch or dinner.

We had a booth in the back near the kitchen. Our waiter took a little bit to come over so by the time he did we had decided on our food. 4 of us decided on the Poutine Scramble, and I got a glass of Brut Champagne which was $7. I&#39;m glad I ordered my drink when I did because the next time we saw our waiter was when we got our food. He brought out the complimentary biscuits with our meal. The timing felt a little off and I think I would have enjoyed more of my biscuit if it came before the meal.<br><br>The scramble was a lot of flavors. It comes with eggs, potatoes, cheese, white gravy, bacon (I think because it might be bacon bits), etc. It&#39;s a lot. I just think I didn&#39;t get gravy on eggs.

It&#39;s hard when a restaurant expands with various locations. Our server Iris was A-Mazing! Kudos to her!!! She was so friendly and spot on! She knew her products well and had such a chipper attitude. She was from Ohio but struck me as a Georgia Peach! We really enjoyed her company! She brought extra sauces and napkins without us asking. We orders what we normally order at the Asheville store....pimento cheese dip, wings and fried green tomatoes. We wanted to order potato cracklins but they said it would take an hour (since they just opened) so we ordered chips which we&#39;re just ok. Right after our food hit the table here comes Iris with an order of cracklins on the house. They were done sooner than they thought and boy were they good. Smashed potatoes deep fried...oh man! So, the wings were good but not as good as we remember from previous visits also the pimento cheese dip taste like it had grain mustard in it which I don&#39;t remember. It was a strong taste that we both didn&#39;t prefer. The tomatoes were good but needed salt also the grit bed needed more flavor. The ranch had a garlic hint to it and wasn&#39;t great but the blue cheese was chunky and on point. <br>I forgot to mention my Bloody Mary- they make their own mix and it is so good! The pepper rim is to die for. So all in all it was a $48 lunch and felt more like it should have been $20. I feel a bit jipped to be honest. Not what I know Tupelo to be!\"\n",

In fact the WORST server we have ever encountered in a long time. <br><br>10 minutes after seated the server finally came ask for drink orders. A moment later someone else came back with water, then another 5 minutes later she came and asked if we were ready to order, I promptly told her we were still waiting on the coffee. She then said&#34; oh so he didn&#39;t bring the coffee out? Alright guess I will get it now.&#34; WHAT? Red flag #1. <br><br>Coffee came out and tasted like it had been sitting there for two days. Since our server once again disappeared, we told the bus boy who dropped off the food to please get her for us. So we told her coffee tasted bad only for her to come back and said that&#39;s what it&#39;s suppose to taste like, in a way like we were lying and she&#39;s doing me a favor to take it off the bill. It&#39;s as if I didn&#39;t drink coffee almost everyday for the past 15 years and I know what coffee should taste like and it&#39;s definitely not sour. Red flag #2.<br><br>Oh and the famous biscuits. Toward the end of the meal she asked if we wanted biscuits. Sure. Although isn&#39;t it suppose to be brought out at the beginning? Moment later she said biscuits are being made and if we still want them. Yes sure. After meal is finished she came back AGAIN and said no biscuits. Still baking. At this point we have no words.  Red flag #3. <br><br>Hey on a side note, food was good. Big portions. We needed couple boxes for the leftovers. So instead of giving us proper size boxes she grabbed 6 little containers, said they are out of big boxes out in the balcony area (meaning she didn&#39;t want to waste her time to walk back inside). It just gets better. She dropped off the check, my husband pulled out the wallet getting ready to pay on the spot as we didn&#39;t want to wait another who know how long before she appears again. Then she had the guts to say &#34;yeah it&#39;s better you give me the card now, they are transitioning me inside so once I go back in it will be awhile&#34;. JUST WOW. <br><br>I&#39;m a generous tipper and never go under 20%, my husband tipped $4 on $30 for this horrible experience.

            "RpYeOtqujjc1ce3gYB_4vw,\"First off I love the vibes of this place, and their biscuits are TO DIE FOR. But I feel like I had waaay to high of expectations when I came here for brunch. We asked for an outside seating, which was a must because the weather was lovely!! I see a lot of families coming here all dressed up nicely for brunch - love(: I came here wanting to order their French toast or shakshuka which I saw on their menu online, but I was so disappointed to not see it on their menu! (Whyyyy) So I stuck with the kale grilled shrimp salad and the lavender limenade. The lavender limenade was really good! You could taste the lavender and they didn&#39;t overly sweeten it so still had the sourness from the lime which is perfect! But the salad, whyyyyy does it taste like I&#39;m eating straight up grass? The yogurt dressing was okay, the pears added a hint of sweetness- great, shrimp was big and banging but the lettuce and radishes tasted like they straight up ripped it up from the ground. My cousins ordered the fried chicken burger, it looked SO bomb but it was legit sitting in a pool of grease. (I&#39;m not even exaggerating) Also, the fries were super duper soggy &amp; tasted like regular frozen fries. Overall the presentation of the foods were awesome! But the taste sadly disappointed me. If I&#39;m ever coming back it would be for sure for the biscuits!\"\n",

Walked in around 10:50 on a Saturday morning and was seated immediately (I didn&#39;t have the same luck on a Sunday)!<br><br>Our waitress came quickly to her our drink orders and when she returned told us she would give us time to look over the menu and if we had any questions. She came back quickly and took our orders (I HATE when waiters/waitresses take too long to get your order after dropping off your drinks!)<br><br>She gave us a short history on the restaurant: where the name came from, locations, where the food comes from, etc. I was excited to hear that almost all of the food is local and grass fed. Don&#39;t judge, I&#39;m going through a local foodie hipster phase (I feel like a lot of people in Charlotte do between Plaza Midwood and NoDa). <br><br>Our food was amazing! I uploaded pics for your viewing pleasure. I must say the biscuits/jam were my FAVORITE part! Its food and appearance, both an ode to the South, are a Southerner&#39;s dream. In my opinion it was an upgrade of Cracker Barrel! A Charlotte favorite, it&#39;s definitely worth a try. <br><br>You&#39;re welcome.\"\n",

Our server, Aleesha (sp?), was welcoming and provided us with great service. When I asked her what she thought about the biscuits and gravy with fried chicken, she replied that everything on the menu is really good. After seeing how pleased my family was at the end of our meal, I realize that she wasn&#39;t lying.<br><br>Our meal started off with homemade biscuits with a side of blueberry compote. These biscuit were so delicious! Soft and fluffy with a nice outer crust. My meal of biscuits and gravy was perfection! It was perfectly seasoned and prepared, it was a true comfort meal and one of the best I had. If you come here, I highly suggest it. The rest of my family had the southern belle grilled cheese, fried chicken BLT, okra, side salad and Mac and cheese. Other than the okra (which was amazing) I didn&#39;t try anyone else&#39;s food but everyone was thrilled with their meals. <br><br>We also had the lavender limeade fizz and and rosemary peach lemonade a which were so delicious!

            "PVyZXgOkVtnU6966FDFhuw,\"Welcome to Charlotte, Tupelo Honey Cafe! Yelpers, get ready to have your taste buds delighted. <br><br>I&#39;ve been anxiously awaiting Tupelo Honey&#39;s arrival to the Charlotte food scene. I&#39;ve heard nothing but amazing things about it but the 1.5-2 hour wait at the one in Asheville left me pining away. But not anymore, as we have our very own! It fills the space once occupied by the Pewter Rose Bistro.<br><br>We were lucky enough to join Tupelo Honey Cafe for a soft opening tonight. Usually restaurants use soft openings to work out kinks and problems, but it didn&#39;t seem like they really needed it. Everything was already operating like a smooth oiled machine. The service was excellent and the food was all superb. They were serving a limited menu but there was still something for everyone. <br><br>Homemade Pimento Cheese and Tortilla Chips - Awesome. The pimento cheese was served hot, reminiscent of a Southern version on queso dip. The chips were also hot and fresh. <br><br>Biscuits: Fresh biscuits served with Tupelo honey and berry jam. So.Freakin.Good. My search for the best biscuit has ended. Tupelo wins. These biscuits are light, fluffy, flaky, buttery, salty, and just damn good. <br><br>SHOO-Mercy Shirmp and Grits: Oh man. A dozen perfectly cooked, succulent shrimp with bacon, caramelized onions, spinach, and sauteed mushrooms all served over goat cheese grits... Read that again... Goat cheese grits! If you aren&#39;t a fan of goat cheese, skip this dish as it is a very dominant flavor. Or better yet, try them and you may discover that goat cheese isn&#39;t all that bad like I did :) <br><br>I also tried the Southern Fried Chicken Saltimbocca. So, so, so good. The chicken was perfectly cooked. So juicy. The country ham, Havarti and Marsala sauce pushed the dish over the top. The cheese smashed cauliflower were a bit of a let down. They just weren&#39;t as exciting as I wanted them to be. <br><br>Finished the dinner off with a piece of Bourbon Pecan Pie. Perfect crust. Tons of pecans on top and ooey gooey pecan pie filling in the middle. You could smell the butter in every bite. Definitely the perfect desert for those with a sweet tooth. <br><br>Side notes... They share the parking lot with The Liberty. They are on the second floor. There are two staircases and an elevator you can use to get up to them. The patio looks awesome! Can&#39;t wait for the weather to get nice to enjoy it. The space inside is beautiful. I love the exposed brick. They have a really nice bar area with TVs and a great selection of local beers on tap and tasty cocktails. Their mint iced tea was a bit on the sweet side for me but I loved the fresh mint flavor. Our waitress, Kat, was very friendly and attentive.<br><br>I can&#39;t wait to try out more of their menu!! See you soon Tupelo Honey Cafe :)\"\n",

On a recent visit, the waittress recommended the &#34;sweet tea chicken&#34;. OMG!  Unless you like chicken that literally tastes like sweet tea - including the &#34;sweet&#34; aspect - stay away from that item. Yesterday I visited with my family. The hostess told us about their specials; both of which are priced so ridiculously high, it is obvious that you&#39;re better off ordering from the regular menu.

To Tupelo Honey Cafe and Johnathan, thank you for making our first day in NC a memorable one.\"\n",

For my first visit, I started with the biscuits and I was already in heaven; warm, soft, flaky, delicious. Some of the other foods I tasted included the pulled pork spring rolls, the fried chicken, the seared scallops and last but not the least, the pecan pie. my favorite of them all was definitely the fried chicken. It&#39;s probably amongst the best fried chicken I&#39;ve ever had. The batter was so flavorful. The chicken was topped with some melted cheese and came with a cauliflower gratin on the side. Moving on from the food...The ambiance was nice &amp; cozy, and the servers seemed very friendly! I&#39;m going back there soon when I&#39;m ready for another divinely semi-unhealthy meal ;)\"\n",

What makes it qualify as crab cake is the tiniest sprinkle of what I am sure is canned crab (or possibly imitation crab) onto the top of the egg. Hollandaise sauce has no flavor, just yellow tinged mayonnaise. I&#39;ve included a picture. My boyfriend was unimpressed with his omelette. The best part were the biscuits that were just....okay. I guess since they are a chain people just come there for that reason and they don&#39;t feel like they need to do well when it comes to the appearance and taste of their food. I expected great food and I expected to see the atmosphere as shown in the pictures. The place is cute but they do not serve your food on nice plates. Your food will be plated on an ugly yellow cafeteria looking plate. Maybe I&#39;m just spoiled with all the truly amazing food options Charlotte has to offer. Tupelo honey is another Olive Garden, Chili&#39;s and Red Lobster. And those might be better. If you want amazing food and a nice atmosphere, try Fahrenheit or The Village Tavern, Dressler&#39;s. The last two mentioned have amazing food and all three have very nice outdoor seating areas. You won&#39;t be disappointed like you will be here.

(Ok, the &#34;mighty&#34; part may be a slight exaggeration)<br><br>My friend and I were looking for a brunch spot that is semi-causal this recent Sunday. We arrived after 1pm, and were faced with a big crowd of people on the balcony already in wait for tables. We were told the wait for a 2-top would be 35 minutes but that all the spaces in the bar area were up for grab. Bar area it was.<br><br>There were lots of empty spots at the bar - all with dirty dishes &amp; glasses piled up in front of. Be warned: &#34;pre-bus&#34; is not a practice or a concept here. We sat at one of the long tables (communal style), and no one greeted us with anything. I ended up getting our own menus, and my friend ended up cleaning up the rest of the table himself (Side note: you would think if a patron ask for a towel to wipe up a dirty table, that someone would come and do it - nope, they just handed him a towel). <br><br>It took forever for drinks to arrive - the bloody mary ($8 for a very small glass) was bloody watery by the time it got to our table. Good thing it was not for me. We enjoyed the biscuits alot, because we were starving at this point. I ordered the Fried Egg BLT ($9) and opt for a cup of soup ($1 add on). My friend ordered a burger. My dish arrived as a Fried CHICKEN BLT - so I had to wait again for my food. My friend&#39;s 2nd bloody mary never made it to the table. At the end the food was OK but I was too busy being baffled by the chaotic/slow/bad service to enjoy much of it.<br><br>In short - it was a nightmare of an experience in terms of service. The food was ok, but not enough for anyone to put up with that amount of incompetence. A word of advice to Management: Do something or you are not going to have much repeat business.

I love the fried green tomatoes and grits so that was my starter and it never disappoints. For my meal, I had the smoked jalapeño fried egg BLT. I opted for the jalapeño aioli on the side because I don&#39;t like things spicy. It was good and not too much kick. The sandwich was good and the potatoes on the side were seasoned great. My only complaint was my bread was too greasy. Not greasy enough that I wouldn&#39;t make another visit. I&#39;d definitely give them another try. Next time, I&#39;d see if it&#39;s consistently greasy or just request it without the buttered bread. Awesome place!!!<br><br>P.S. The $3 mimosas were great too!!!\"\n",

            "sVn_rNopTpPik0iL_Xm7ag,\"I really really don&#39;t get the intrigue about this place. I had this place booked marked for months to visit but once i experienced the food, it was a huge letdown. They specialize in southern food, all that means is everything is fried in oil. I ordered the the trout as the main dish. My two sides had fancy names but what came out were fried hunks of potatoes and tasteless Mac and cheese. The only thing that was interesting was the fried tomatoes served on a bed of grits as an appetizer. Moreover these everyday foods were sold for premium pricing. The service was lacsidasical. It took us an hour and a half to eat and leave, when we could have been done in an hour. Overall I don&#39;t see myself coming back and I just don&#39;t understand the intrigue. The fans and decor were interesting.\"\n",

I appreciated the option nonetheless. Parking there is kind of iffy - I wish we had gotten an Uber or something. Other than that we had a wonderful experience! Our server Kevin was lovely and explained every question we had. The carolina dip was really yummy! Wish we would have known that you get biscuits while you wait because we ended up not being able to finish the main course. The only bad thing was that they were out of pretty much every pork product there. Kevin explained that sometimes they run out because of the cooking process (which made it sound even more delicious!!!). We will be back!!\"\n",

Everyone is served at the same time except for one person. 2:40 PM The same person has no meal while everyone else is eating. Now it&#39;s time to have a talk with the manager. He apologizes... and takes 50% off the meal (except alcohol) and throws in dessert. 2:45 PM the final meal comes out.

Essentially, they kept telling us the issue was that a couple at 1 of our 4 tables closed out and continued to sit... and sit.. and sit.<br>I don&#39;t know about anywhere else, but the 3 restaurants I&#39;ve worked at that accepted reservations always had ways around these issues, such as setting the expectations when the tables are sat that a reso is set for a later time, or, not seating that section at least an hour prior, if not longer. If you can&#39;t make large reservations work, don&#39;t take them. However, all the GM wanted to do, was whine to me about how he had to offer the couple a free brunch on their next visit to get them to finally leave- in my opinion, he could have handled that couple and myself much better. His attitude was something that could potentially prevent my fiancé and I from returning, and we truly loved our brunches there (this why we chose it for such an important event).<br>All in all, once the guest relations manager and servers came in, all was well. We were on a time crunch after being sat so late, so our food came very quickly and appetizers were sent out free of charge as soon as we sat. Without them, our engagement Brunch, and first family gathering would have been a disaster.\"\n",

            "sNjj-uGmFVHz9rhIxUuvYw,\"First time here - this location was chosen by a friend who arranged the get-together of a party of eight of us. She had initially called to see whether she could make reservations for Saturday brunch and was told that they didn&#39;t arrange reservations for that time of the day. I was the first person to arrive to a very busy, very crowded hostess station, and I was told that we could expect a one-hour wait. Big party, I get that. We had cocktails while we waited - bar staff were on top of their game: We walked up to the corner of the bar, immediately had our orders taken and drinks in hand within just a few minutes. Finally seated after about an hour and a half (big party, limited seating, we get it). Jonathan was our amazing server, and really, if he is available, you&#39;d be wise to request him because he&#39;s the best! Charming, knowledgeable, and he did a great job of seeing to our needs without being omnipresent.<br><br>New menu for those who had been there before, but I was new anyway, and I liked the menu - a lot. The fried green tomatoes were perfectly prepared - warm, succulent, not soggy, with a crisp coating that had a spicy kick. The chicken and biscuits were enjoyed by a couple of our table mates - you can order it regular or spicy, and with or without eggs. The Appalachian breakfast plate was practically licked by one guy. The French toast with pork belly was also cleaned by another guy at the table. My husband devoured a folded omelet with bacon, fried green tomato, and a stack of other deliciousness in the middle. I had the grit cake with salmon - it was a massive entree and I couldn&#39;t finish it, but the flavors were beautifully balanced and I would order it again and again. I also had a lavender-infused lime drink (NA, as I was a DD) that was delicious. <br><br>If you go: 1. Be patient, it&#39;s worth it. 2. Ask for Jonathan. 3. Enjoy!\"\n",

The service today was soooooo sloooow <br>It must&#39;ve been an off day for them. The A/C was very cold and people were complaining about that and there was no soap in the men&#39;s restroom and posted above the sink was a sign stating &#34;all employees must wash their hands.&#34; That was a little unsettling. I think, if the management would tighten everything up a bit, this place would be deserving of 4 or 5 stars because as I stated before, the food and options are terrific.\"\n",

I had waited and waited to try it, due to the crazy wait times (and my boyfriend not being the waiting type)... until FINALLY we decided it was TIME. <br><br>The wait actually wasn&#39;t bad 10 minutes or so for the two of us. I really like the setup and the interior of this restaurant. It&#39;s beautiful. Our sever recommended the huge mimosas to us, but neglected to tell us they wouldn&#39;t hit our table until 15 minutes after we had ordered them. That aside, she raved about the chicken blt and sold us both on it, so we ordered two one with all and cheese one with fries (mine minus the mustard). She also recommended it spicy for something different ( I love spicy so I let her sell me on that too). <br><br>They bring out biscuits with jam and honey which we&#39;re phenomenal and filling while we waited for our drinks. <br><br>When the mimosas finally appeared I was not impressed. They boast an extra 2oz of champagne but mine tasted like straight orange juice so it was definitely not worth the $10 price tag. <br><br>Our food came out fairly quickly given how busy they were. The presentation looked nice. But they neglected to leave the mustard off of mine, and its flavor completely overshadowed any of the spiciness that was promised. The chicken itself was good. Not completely tender, slightly overcooked, but decent. Mac and cheese was flavorless, the fries were good, but there were only about 15 of them on my plate.<br><br>Our server didn&#39;t check back on us until our food was gone hence me never mentioning the mustard. She was pretty lifeless. <br><br>I don&#39;t know, they definitely didn&#39;t live up to the hype. And with a $53 price tag for two... I left hungry and disappointed - the value and output are definitely not worth it.\"\n",

The only thing that I might say is even better than the food was the service that we got from our server, Jonathan.

We didn&#39;t get only of their Queen Mary&#39;s this time, but after seeing a few people order them, I&#39;d say we&#39;ll definitely get it next time. Also, the portions are huge!

We got there at 5 pm on a Friday because my sister has a young child and they tend to eat on the earlier side and because we needed to be out of there relatively quickly. Although the restaurant was almost completely empty, we had to wait almost 15 minutes to get a table (and that was after we finally asked if we could be seated soon because we had to be somewhere).<br><br>Lots of credit to our server who was great with my 2 year old nephew and brought his food out ASAP.  To be honest, my nephew&#39;s sweet potato pancake that I stole a bite of was probably the best out of everything we ordered. Unfortunately, the vegetarian options for the adults were just weak (I think they just rolled out a new menu?) and we basically had to order a bunch of sides. Not impressed.  There wasn&#39;t even a veggie sandwich option.<br><br>Mac and cheese came out cold so we had to send it back. The edamame was a bit soggy and just didn&#39;t taste that fresh. We ordered the pimiento cheese appetizer but it didn&#39;t come out until after we got the main course (it was clear they forgot about it). <br><br>I hear they are opening up a branch in Arlington, Virginia soon, so hopefully that branch will get its act together (and actually have some good vegetarian options too).\"\n",

I&#39;ve always heard great things, but never had an excuse to venture out until recently. I went on a Sunday morning to meet two of my friends for brunch. We had an 11AM reservation, and when we first arrived, there were a few parties waiting to be seated, but we were quickly given a table. I will say, as we left, it was PACKED and there were many parties waiting for a table. So if you can, make a reservation.<br><br>Breakfast/brunch is my favorite meal - period. I love anything breakfast, but when I go to brunch I usually get the &#39;everything&#39; meal (eggs, bacon, pankcakes, etc...). If I don&#39;t do that, I will get the eggs benedict. I decided to go outside the box and ordered their breakfast bowl. YUM! I would never have ordered this because it&#39;s not my kind of dish, but I&#39;d seen a photo online and it looked so tasty. Plus, being a southern fresh food kind of place, I decided to give it a try. I am SO glad I did. It was more than enough food, but it was so good I ate it all up! <br><br>My friends both got the BLT sandwich, which they seemed to like, but both complained it was greasy and they needed to wash their hands before leaving. We all ordered coffee - it was good coffee. The goat cheese grits were so tasty. I love goat cheese, but even if you don&#39;t like goat cheese, don&#39;t let that scare you away. It wasn&#39;t strong, it was just savory, creamy &amp; cheesy. No extra salt or pepper needed. While we waited for our food, our waiter brought perfectly cooked homemade biscuits and homemade blueberry jam/jelly. The jam/preserves (whatever it&#39;s called) was really good. I&#39;d buy it to take home. I had a few pieces of blueberry in it, but they weren&#39;t tough or dry or unwelcomed at all. I liked the pieces. Our waiter was fantastic as well. He was patient when we needed more time and helpful when needed.

I want more NOW.........<br>Please do not leave this place without trying the BANANA PUDDING. I will be back very very soon....\"\n",

We walked up the steep steps to slowly and leisurely be greeted by the hostess. We were seated in a nice booth, and the ambiance of the cafe is really nice. Cool designs, light fixtures, and just a really creative, unique layout. That was the best part of our experience here..ha. Our waitress brought us our menus and then pretty much forgot about us for 15 minutes. Once we finally ordered we waiting another 25-30 minutes to get our food. YIKES. It was weird, I actually laughed when I saw our food coming. One of the chefs (I&#39;m guessing) brought our food out and my salad was pressed up against his shirt while he was struggling to carry the other two plates. As for the food...ehh. My personal opinion is that their beautifully put together menu is much better than the actual execution. I got the signature salad, it was okay, it had ALOT of dressing. My mom got the county fried avacado, the breading was very overpowering. We also got a side of baked mac and cheese which tasted like it was warmed up in the microwave from last night then sat out for a couple minutes. My sister got the southern belle grilled cheese and boy was that weird looking. The bread was a bit soggy and the cheese wasn&#39;t really melted, but the flavor was there.

She told me it was really spicy and suggested the cheese grits to help mellow it out to which I agreed. The biscuits are the best thing here. The fried chicken was soggy and dry and hardly spicy.

Let me start by saying that you know that you can have fantastic food, but poor wait staff service and I will never return to your establishment. I know this is true for me and what&#39;s also true is that I may be the most analytical person alive. <br>Now let&#39;s get to the review for TUPELO HONEY and EMERSON! If you&#39;ve been here you know their food is delicious. It&#39;s a southern twist with a beautiful ambience. We would have dined outside, but it was raining so we opted to dine in. We started with the Pimento Cheese Nachos as an appetizer. They were seasoned to perfection and were so delicious. While waiting on the appetizer, Emerson brought out some biscuits and blueberry preserves!  The biscuits were good but the preserves, all I can say is Shoo Mercy( when you visit you be saying the same thing). For our main course, we had Shoo Mercy Shrimp And Grits and Shoo Mercy Pancakes. It&#39;s was amazing! The Shoo Mercy Shrimp and Grits was recommended by our waiter. And he was right, it made me say Shoo Mercy! Lol the Shoo Mercy Pancakes was one of his recommendations as well, it had potato pancakes and southern fried chicken. Such an amazing combination. Shoo Mercy, once again! <br>Now, what really made our experience so unforgettable was our waiter, EMERSON! This guy gets 5 STARS. He was knowledgable from the menu selection to the history of &#34;Shoo Mercy&#34;.  Most of all he had energy and made us feel like it was his pleasure to make our dinning experience pleasurable. It was my birthday dinner and although he wasn&#39;t aware,  he made my birthday dinner one that will never be forgotten. His customer service and just his attentiveness was unprecedented for that level of dining. You would expect his customer service level at maybe The Fig Tree Restaurant. We will return and will definitely ask to be seated in Emerson&#39;s area. Thanks Emerson!\"\n",

            "Ue6GHzS2pHRLpi3tfqcJ6Q,\"I recently went to the Tupelo location in Charlotte. After visiting the one in Raleigh I thought it was the perfect place to celebrate my birthday. The majority of my experience was wonderful the food was great. My main issue came with the service. My best friend arrived before me and asked &#34;what do yall do for birthdays?&#34; and she got the response that they sing happy birthday and the typical restaurant thing. My reservation stated that it was my birthday and also my friends had a balloon at the table that says &#34;happy birthday&#34; on it. So towards the end of the service we realized another table was also celebrating a birthday and we watched as everyone sang happy birthday and ice cream was brought out with a candle in it. It was extremely awkward waiting for my turn which never came. When my best friend ask the server why I didn&#39;t receive one she said in a rude tone &#34;well maybe they paid for it?&#34; When I&#39;ve always know it to be customary. I was extremely embarrassed. I hate to blame everything on race but its so heart breaking watching a table full of white people being recognized for a birthday and it seeming as though me being a person of color my birthday was irrelevant. I came to celebrate another year of my life and i left with my heart in my stomach basically. When i left carrying a &#34;happy birthday&#34; balloon and random people were telling me happy birthday but i was just made to feel like it did not even matter. When i tell you I absolutely love this restaurant and to have been treated like this on my birthday it was extremely hurtful, embarrassing, and I feel as though i&#39;m not even welcomed there. I filed a complaint after the evening just did not sit right with me. The response that I received from the general manager David Gordon was &#34; We do not sing, have never sung here and we do not have candles.  Not sure where this women ate???&#34; After which I replied I felt further disrespected. The final email I received stated that &#34;  I did not realize you were linked into our messages.&#34;  Never again will I spend my money at an establishment such as this that does not respect me as a person.\"\n",

I drove from Jacksonville FL to spend my birthday with family and friends in Charlotte/Concord. My best friend went to the honey Tupelo restaurant in Asheville and suggested weeks ago that we should have dinner at this restaurant. Being the foodie I am, I started researching and couldn&#39;t wait to dine here. <br>We arrive at the restaurant on time for our reservation on a Wednesday night @615p. The floor was empty, and The hostess looked lost and started pulling tables together for our party of 10. We sat down and was greeted promptly by our server. We ordered or drinks, and waited a full 45 minutes for our first(and only) mixed drinks and even longer to begin our food order. Totally unacceptable. We were then informed there was a party of 35 and that our food would be delayed. Begrudgingly we all accepted. We ordered our food.<br><br> what came next? Cold Food. One person didn&#39;t get their tacos till 20 min after our food was delivered. &amp; We were still missing a kids Mac&amp;chz. We were all starving that we inevitably shared and ate our dishes. But mid meal, our children started fussing that the food tasted bad. As parents this is not uncommon to hear. So we tried a spoonful of the buttered pasta.... sure enough it tasted like dirty dish water, one friend felt there was maybe some chemicals mixed in. It was just overall disgusting. <br>The other kids dish we ordered was macaroni and cheese. Now, the portion of the macaroni in comparison to the buttered pasta was ridiculous. If I&#39;m being generous it was a square 3inx3in piece on a tea plate. With no sides.<br><br>The adult plates, chicken fried steak was compared to a rubber boot. The sides of the flat iron steak, were severely bland Brussels sprouts. Almost as if they were boiled in the hospitals cafeteria and served to you for health not enjoyment. <br><br>So I finally get the nerve to complain. I really am understanding. If the place was hopping, you have a serious wait. If the server was in the weeds about to wave her white flag. I&#39;d totally get it. But what I encountered was the extreme opposite. An empty floor, with two parties, a 35 top (that was mid way they their meals when we arrived) and my 10 top. <br><br>The manager came over, very apologetic. Discounted our check, removed the kids food, replaced the buttered pasta with grilled cheese. Did everything you should do for a disgruntled customer. He redeemed himself when he presented a free (bland, boring) chocolate cake and a Tupelo honey recipe book. <br><br>BUT THEN it went down hill again. Took over 30 minutes to get our check after the dessert came. The bill was incredibly wrong. They triple charged us for one appetizer. They couldn&#39;t seem to understand that they needed to take 2 appetizers off since we only ordered one! So that added another 15 min. It was just a complete mess. We didn&#39;t leave till 830. Over two hours wasted at a poor quality, poor service, poor dining restaurant. <br><br>Save your time and go somewhere else. The biscuits aren&#39;t even worth it.\"\n",

But it was still very delicious! Seasoned and fried perfectly. <br><br>Biscuits came out warm and fresh. And the jam was delicious. Yum! But don&#39;t eat too much in order to save room for the meal!<br><br>Also I usually don&#39;t like banana pudding, but the waiter surprised us with banana pudding on the house (after hearing it was my birthday) and I loved it!! Totally ate all of it.\"\n",

A local said she tried everything in the menu and said we wouldn&#39;t be disappointed. The sweet potato pancakes were a hit. I think the peach butter was a unique option for this dish. We were brought fresh biscuits with the homemade blueberry jam.  The omelettes were large. Share if you can. I tried the shoo omelette-It was tasty and the bacon was crisp. Also tried the fried green tomatoes with the goat cheese grits. We were definitely pleased with each dish we tried. <br>Service was on point.

It is topped with nuts and butter, but the best topping is the friend chicken. I have never been a fan of chicken with breakfast foods but this experience has completely changed my mind. It was perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. It also seemed to have a slight honey taste which was the perfect accompaniment and made this chicken absolutely heavenly. My boyfriend got the omelet and the waiter was not joking when he said this would be plenty to eat without needing a side! It was HUGE!! We both were pleasantly stuffed when we finished eating.<br><br>The drinks were also quite tasty! The giant mimosa was plenty to drink and not too strong. Exactly what I was hoping for on a Saturday morning. My boyfriend got their special huge bloody mary that was made with yellow tomatoes. Now I am not usually a fan of bloody marys but this was actually really good! It had a different taste than a traditional bloody mary which I liked and he said it was the best bloody mary he has ever tasted, and he is a regular fan. He did say he wasn&#39;t sure it was quite worth the $15 but it was his birthday so it was a nice treat.<br><br>As much as I have raved about the food, I also can&#39;t say enough good things about the overall environment and wait staff. Our waiter made us feel extremely comfortable and really went over the menu since it was our first time. He made us feel special with the biscuits and provided recommendations on menu items.

First, we were told that it would be a 35-45 minute wait for a group of five. <br>Ok no big deal! For a Saturday evening at dinner time that&#39;s to be expected. The problem was that for the entire 40 minutes that we waited to get seated,  multiple tables sat empty the entire time. Some of them had reserved signs, however 40 minutes in advance is ridiculous....or if the party that made the reservation is that late??? When we were finally seated, we were placed at a table that I had noticed being made ready 20 minutes prior to them calling us!! Why so long? <br>Secondly, all the host/hostest up front kept playing around with other employees and goofing off and didn&#39;t seem to be motivated. <br>Once we were seated we had to ask for most everything twice and some of the food was not brought out when we received our order. <br>I am very disappointed in the service and the food was far too overpriced for the quality.<br>I will not be going back.\"\n",

But I have to say our last visit was VERY DISAPPOINTING  <br><br>We started off with the Fried Green Tomatoes which were great. That was followed by their famous biscuits and homemade jam, also very good. <br><br>I ordered the buttermilk  fried chicken with collard greens and black-eyed peas as my sides. They use a boneless chicken breast for that dish. The chicken arrived with the breading clumped in pieces falling off and one side had no breading at all. This is fried chicken 101. Chick fil a cooks a million of these every day and they don&#39;t come out like that.<br><br>The server said it&#39;s a chicken breast so....? As if to say, well that&#39;s normal. It was not.  I said, I am going to need another one because this was not satisfactory to me. I kept my sides while she sent the chicken back to the kitchen. The second piece was better, but we could have done a better job at home. In past experiences here the fried chicken has been really good, one of my favs but not this night. My greens were good, my black-eyed peas were undercooked, more like al dente. They were fixed in a nontraditional way, almost like baked beans with a sweeter taste.That&#39;s not necessarily a bad idea, they did have good flavor. But because they were not cooked properly, I could not eat them.  After complaining about the chicken, I didn&#39;t sent them back but I should have. <br><br>My husband had the Carolina Mountain Trout with a cornbread stuffing. He stated the trout had a good flavor but he expected the skin to be seared and crispier and it seems that they just roasted the fish. So he removed the skin. His sides were Brussels Sprouts and Hominy and Mac &amp; Cheese. The sprouts were roasted not sautéed, had a good flavor but a little salty. The Mac &amp; Cheese was soupy.<br><br>TH takes limited reservations and since it was a Friday night, I decided to do so. I noticed on their website that they had a new chef from NYC, who is highly acclaimed. I wondered how much experience he had with Southern Cuisine. Obviously you can be from another region and cook Southern, but it would seem that you would need some type of experience in the cuisine (like Emril Laagasse worked in NOLA for years before getting his own restaurants there). The other concerning thing was that TH has really expanded to a lot of states, going as far as Denver. You always have to wonder when that happens, is growth happening too fast,  and are they sacrificing quality for expansion. They have made changes to the menu, added a drink menu and a prix fixe menu which are great ideas, but if the food is lacking, that will not matter.<br><br>We mentioned to our server that we thought TH were having an off night and overall the meal was not what we usually expect from them. She mentioned the new chef and the difficulty of the cooks to execute the changes on the menu. She seemed to suggest that they needed more training. Apparently others had complained as well. She stated the peas were meant to be al dente. I don&#39;t know any Southern home cook who would allow black eyed peas to be served undercooked, so that totally needs to change, IMO.<br><br>I don&#39;t know why the determination was made to make changes to the menu and bring in a new chef. TH was already doing Southern Cuisine with a flare. If it ain&#39;t broke, don&#39;t fix it. We will try them again for Lunch or Brunch. But if we have another bad experience, this restaurant will probably be taken off our list of favorites.\"\n",

Instead, I was left wanting more. <br><br>In my books, Tupelo is more of a 3.5 than a 4, but not a 3. Bottom line is they have staff issues. It almost feels to me that they were not properly trained to meet the demand of being the new kid on the block with high expectations. They did a great job of building excitement on Facebook and I think Charlotte residents were hoping for another great brunch spot on Sunday afternoons. <br><br>Here are my issues from a customer point of interaction: <br><br>Parking - always has and continues to be a challenge at this location. Not much can be done here. <br><br>Customer Service - warm greeting when entering... and we were lucky enough to be seated relatively quickly. <br><br>Wait Staff - friendly, but a little forgetful with long periods of time between receiving food and receiving service. <br><br>Food - Food is good. I expected more in terms of flavor. It wasn&#39;t bad and it wasn&#39;t great... but not memorable. <br><br>I want to love you Tupelo... I want to be a fan, but adjustments have to be made in order for me to become a returning customer and one that recommends you. <br><br>I&#39;ll be giving you a try in Asheville soon!\"\n",

Tupelo honey changed that in the best possible way. The food is a great introduction to the south - a modern take on southern food or a southern take on modern food, it is a delicious way to acclimatize yourself to this quaintly odd area. And oh my god, the complimentary biscuits they serve you at the beginning of the meal are amazing!! Along with the homemade blueberry jam and freshly collected, warmed honey, it&#39;s irresistible. And leaves you waning just a but more. Sigh, if only it were on the menu.<br><br>But the things that are on the menu are also great!

Other women in my group ordered different things such as the sweet potato pancakes amongst others and everyone said that the food was good.

We made reservations and since I came to catch up with a friend, we obviously started chatting. Our waiter asked us if we wanted any alcoholic drinks, we declined and his demeanor got odd. <br><br>Our waiter was obviously in a hurry to get us in and out as he stopped by our table three times before we even had a chance to look at a menu. <br><br>We had just sat down and already had the feeling like we needed to leave. Nobody spends $14 on avocado toast to shove it down their throats and leave. <br><br>We also heard about these famous biscuits and jam and we didn&#39;t receive any, so of course that was disappointing as well. <br><br>As we were eating and catching up, multiple times our waiter would jump from behind us and say &#34;HOWS IT GOING!&#34; like he was trying to be funny and scare us. It was bizarre behavior, happened multiple times, and made me extremely uncomfortable. <br><br>What really takes the cake, though, is at the end he told us to give him a five star review on Yelp so he could win a free meal.

Our waiter was very courteous, attentive and informative and we found that be true of all the staff encountered.<br><br>We started with Mega Mimosas and a Bloody Mary which everyone enjoyed and got the Fried Green Tomatoes over Goat Cheese Grits as a starter. This was REALLY good, the only thing was that there were only 4 very small slices of tomato. I&#39;ve never seen such a small green tomato but since we had our breakfasts still to come, it wasn&#39;t a big deal. The goat cheese grits were AMAZING though. I love goat cheese and grits and found these to be delicious! They put a lot of basil shreds on top which they could put a little less of but it&#39;s a nice flavor with the goat cheese. I just pulled some off.<br><br>My mom ordered the &#34;Samlette&#34;, or omelette with salmon inside which she said she enjoyed, but wished the salmon inside was warm, as it was room temp to cool. I ordered over medium eggs one of which came out that way and the other was over easy but still good. They bacon was sort of fatty which I don&#39;t really like so next time I&#39;ll be sure to order extra crispy. We all really loved the biscuit with blueberry jam they give each person and we all left super stuffed and happy!<br><br>Over all it seemed a little pricey for what we got, but still a good meal and we would all return :)\"\n",

The regular, no frills Bloody Mary I had while waiting at the bar was pretty good and I really liked the sitting area outside.  Ok, so that rounds out the good.  Let&#39;s move on to the drubbing Tupelo Honey deserves.<br><br>I don&#39;t even know where to start other than to say this place is a beacon of mediocrity placed on a pedestal by the simpleminded masses.<br><br>1. The Queen Mary.  This was really the crown jewel of the meal.  In the sense that it cost a kings ransom and then didn&#39;t deliver. On top of the terrible flavor it was so thick it was almost impossible to drink.<br><br>2. The goat cheese grit&#39;s are a good idea in theory, but even the greatest grits in the world are not good cold.<br><br>3. The Shoo Mercy Omelet was truly egregious.  Nothing like a crepe thin, flavorless egg mix crammed full of way too much, of way too many things.  It&#39;s supposed to be big and caloric and unwieldy, that&#39;s the whole point. However, instead of inserting entire fried green tomatoes and other intact chunks of filling, you have to break it up a little. Instead of using what was almost certainly 2 milk stretched eggs... you should be using at least 4-6 unmolested ones if you really want to do it right..and season them with something, please. It barely had any pimento cheese in it and what it did have was in one bite.  Run of the mill bacon and ham that had recently seen the likes of a peel-able plastic enclosure. It was incredibly disappointing and I only finished half of it, as I refuse to eat 2000+ calories of complete and utter crap.<br><br>4.  The grilled cheese my girlfriend ordered literally did not have cheese on it.  Don&#39;t really know what else to say about that. <br><br>5.  Everything tastes the same.<br><br>Tupelo Honey, to me, is an exemplar of paradoxical dining patterns and preferences in our society.  Bottom-line: it&#39;s big box, watered down southern BS with a smile, yall.  Something along the lines of Bubba Gump Shrimp Company having a bastard child with Bob Evans.\"\n",

The atmosphere is very inviting- there are many seats however it is not overly loud. The way the tables are situated with the separators, made it also seem intimate. Our waitress, Lauren, was very friendly and very knowledgeable with the menu. The pimento cheese appetizer was not too spicy nor was it too runny which made it easy to dip the chips into. My husband raved over the peach poblano pork ribs (small plates section) and enjoyed the cole slaw which accompanied it. The portion was a nice size and could be considered a meal if someone wasnt too hungry. I enjoyed the bean burger, which had the proper amount of seasoning, along with a side of mac and cheese. I dont care for hamburger buns so I put that aside and just ate the burger- I am really able to taste the sauce this way and it was good. The fried chicken with milk gravy, mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts was also ordered and consumed with lots of &#39;Yumms and boy is this good&#39; comments. Overall, we had a great experience. There is valet parking outside the restaurant if you wish or just drive further down the street and there is a lot on the right specially for Tupelo Honey Cafe customers. One thing to note- while the food was fantastic, all the items I mentioned might not be available. We were told that the Ashville location is the only location which doesnt change/rotate their menu items. Although this shouldnt really matter too much because based on our experience, anything you order will taste good\"\n",

All of our drinks were great; we had wine, margaritas and other mixed drinks. The drinks were strong enough for the price and well sized.<br><br>Everything you read about the biscuits is true: they are AMAZING. Best biscuit I&#39;ve had in a long time; possibly in forever :)<br><br>For entrees we tried the Chicken Piccata w/shrimp, Shrimp and Grits, Grilled Cheese and soup, the Veggie Bowl and the Veggie platter. Portion sizes were great and the food was excellent!! We laughed because there was literally not a single crumb left on any of the six plates. Other than licking them clean, we each ate every last bite!!<br><br>For dessert we ordered the banana pudding: it&#39;s EXCEPTIONAL!!!! Seriously, between the biscuits, entree and dessert, we left very full!<br><br>Best part was the bill; $76 for 2 people including 4 drinks, 2 entrees, dessert and tax. To me, that&#39;s a great value in Charlotte!<br><br>Thanks for the wonderful night out: we will be back (next time for breakfast) :)\"\n",

We shared the Southern Belle grilled cheese that was Brie Gorgonzola with house made pear &amp; onion marmalade and it was delicious! The highlight was the Buttermilk Honey  cheesecake! Our server, Jonathan, was exceptional. He was cordial, knowledgeable and prompt with our orders!\"\n",

Thanks to putting our names on the list ahead of time, we are able to skip the hour and a half wait - 5 stars for that decision. However, our good fortune was spoiled by the server who introduced herself with a very melancholy attitude and appeared to be relatively clueless about the menu; she was very poor at helping a member of our group who was gluten free (she thought rice had gluten, so getting good answers about the right dish to get was clearly futile) - 1 Star. The food ranged in quality. My Shoo Mercy Omelet was really good (5 stars), but my friend&#39;s southwestern omelet that was supposed to have chorizo basically tasted like an omelet full of Manwich (1 Star and I highly advise this dish changing to be REAL chorizo). The other dishes - a breakfast bowl and salad - were two and four stars, respectively as the breakfast bowl in particular had very soupy grits. Average that out and what do you get? Three stars.\"\n",

I sat at the bar as there is a big rush during lunch hours and had a wonderful experience.  I ordered the Appalachian Bounty Scramble which contains all-natural pasture-raised Hickory Nut Gap Farm sausage, blueberries, arugula, kale and Havarti cheese.  It also comes with a side of toast and carrot and kale slaw. It was delicious! I devoured the entire plate in addition to the biscuit and homemade jam that is served at the beginning of your meal. <br><br>I recently brought my parents here, as I was raving about this place. I would be giving this place 4/5 stars, however, the service was sub par.  This time I ordered the Big Honkin&#39; veggie burger with the homemade potato chips and asked for no onion (of course onion came on it). My dad ordered an omelette and my mom ordered the Appalachian Bounty Scramble with the sausage on the side as she does not eat meat, but I was going to eat it. Inside of no sausage it came with DOUBLE sausage, which was incorrectly inputed by our waitress. She haphazardly apologized and took her meal away. Upon bringing her the correct item, she brought her food out piecemeal...one plate with the scramble sans sausage, and then a small plate with a tiny amount of slaw and the grilled toast.  I don&#39;t think that the waitress should have taken the item off of the bill but at least offer us free drinks or a dessert. I was extremely disappointed in how she handled the situation.  Hopefully Tupelo will be better next time.\"\n",

Fried green tomatoes, pickled jalapeño, ham, bacon, pimiento cheese. Yeah not so great, the collabo does not come together well at all but it looked pretty.<br>I had the Shoo Mercy Pancake. You know I should have had a clue when I tried the dough biscuit! Huge portion and I think that was the problem along with the not so good batter used. Huge cake not cooked long enough, had heavy (not fluffy again) consistency, and then a slight gingerbread/spice flavor not at all like the sweet potato description. Doing too much! FLUFFY Buttermilk pancake topped with the apple cider bacon, fried buttermilk chicken could have been darn near perfect but the moment was ruined with too much going on spice wise.<br>The fried green tomatoes appetizer was ok.

While Van Morrison&#39;s song title got me in the door for lunch, I didn&#39;t expect anything other than standard Southern fried fare. This standard often translates into too much of everything: too much butter, too much grease, heaping portions. For an expat Southerner now living on the West Coast, this oversizing isn&#39;t necessarily a good thing. <br><br>Surprise! This place got it right. <br><br>I was served a bit buttery biscuit as an appetizer that came with blackberry jam and tupelo honey, but I could actually taste the fruit instead of just sugary jelly. I opted for the veggie plate. The black eyed peas had a nice kick and weren&#39;t just boiled bland mush, the brussels sprouts were tender, and the highlight--the fried okra was lightly breaded, allowing the full taste to come through. This is how veggies should be prepared and Tupelo Honey Cafe proves not just my Grandma can do it! <br><br>They even have a Gluten Free Menu. <br><br>Forget Paula&#39;s place further down, bring your out-of-town guests here!\"\n",

Ordered the mimosas which took 20 minutes to get. This place is over priced and the only reason I&#39;m giving them 3 stars is the manager did apologize for the service and provided a comp meal for my breakfast since I didn&#39;t eat it.

I chose the browned butter brussels sprouts as my side. More butter than I would have liked and they were a bit under seasoned but tasty, nonetheless.<br><br>Other half ordered the chicken piccata. I&#39;ve never seen chicken piccata with shrimp, much less without capers, but it must have been good because he completely cleaned his plate.<br><br>Oh...and the biscuits! Yummy! And served with honey (naturally) and blueberry jelly. I&#39;d come back just for those!<br><br>My only problem was the pricing. The chicken piccata was 18 bucks! But...like I said, he cleaned that plate so I suppose it was worth it.  Maybe next time I&#39;ll hit the patio and do some people watching!<br><br>I&#39;ll definitely come back. Maybe nex\"\n",

            "x37OyP--VEFE5p-xreplYA,\"Get it together, THC Charlotte. I know you&#39;ve only been open for two weeks, so I should cut you some slack. But i&#39;m not sure, after my experience this week, I can justify visiting you again. <br><br>I walked in at 4:45 on Monday afternoon, ravenous and ready to indulge. There was one table occupied, and approximately 17 servers standing around joking with each other.  I was supposed to be meeting my sister, who was stuck in traffic, but I thought I&#39;d go ahead and order a drink and appetizer while I waited for her. NO CAN DO. The hostesses informed me that 75% of my party needed to be there before I could be seated. Incredulous, I took a slow look around the restaurant recognizing that there were approximately 12 servers per person currently dining. Sensing my annoyance, the hostess laughed and said &#34;I know it seems silly but that&#39;s our rule.&#34;  I understand that rule. I&#39;m actually for that rule. WHEN IT MAKES SENSE. Does it really make sense to annoy the third person to patronize your establishment that evening?  Get a grip, THC. Rules make the world work, but please teach your employees some common sense in applying those rules. <br><br>After awkwardly standing in the foyer looking at the nearly empty restaurant for five minutes, a manager finally came over and allowed me to be seated. From this point forward, the service was excellent. Our waiter was the perfect mix of attentive but not annoying. When my meal turned out not to be up to the THC Asheville standard, the manager insisted on trying to make it again but better this time, and I appreciated the effort.<br><br>The PIMM&#39;S CUP, made with Pimm&#39;s (fruit infused gin), cucumber, and ginger ale, was delicious and refreshing. The food, however was a big disappointment. <br><br>FRIED GREEN TOMATO appetizer - the cornmeal breading was crunchy but otherwise lacked flavor, and the goat cheese grits smelled of goat cheese more than tasted.  With no other sauce or flavor, these ended up being dry and bland. I&#39;m usually a big fan of fried green tomatoes, but if the breading is not delicious on its own, the dish really needs some remoulade sauce or chunks of goat cheese to make up for it. 1/5<br><br>MISSE&#39;S ASHEVILLE&#39;S VEGGIE MELT - I&#39;ve had this three times at the Asheville location and enjoyed it, to varying degrees, every time.  This time the bread was soggy and lacked any sourdough flavor, and the cooks were a little heavy-handed with the Havarti cheese melted on top. The crunch of the fried green tomato was completely lacking, so the entire sandwich felt like a big pile of mushy soggy limp vegetables with no textural differences at all. The lemon aoli is amazing. Really. It is! That&#39;s one of the main reasons I keep ordering this dish. Unfortunately that alone could not save this sandwich. 0/5<br><br>CHEESY CAULIFLOWER BISQUE - nothing memorable, other than that it wasn&#39;t good enough to eat more than a few spoonfuls. The biscuit croutons were definitely a nice touch. But the soup lacked flavor. 0/5<br><br>TOMATO SOUP-  unfortunately, same review as above. The croutons were nice, but the soup itself lacked flavor and wasn&#39;t good enough to waste stomach space. 1/5<br><br>SHOO GRILLED CHEESE - grilled cheese sandwich with fried green tomatoes, sautéed veggies, bacon and hot, melty pimento cheese. What&#39;s not to like? This was the one item that seemed good; unfortunately it was my sister&#39;s. 4/5<br><br>FRIED OKRA with CAROLINA WHITE SAUCE - the okra was fine. Nicely crispy. But the white sauce... Not. Good. At. All. Ask for the lemon aoli to dip the okra in; it&#39;s much better. 2.5/5<br><br>The location, in the old Pewter Rose, is great, and I love the outdoor seating. That will be great when the weather is a little better. The restaurant and bar areas are both very large and will accommodate quite a crowd, even more so than the Asheville location.\"\n",

            "_0BvMFOXCcyznisT0lLc5A,\"4 Stars is exactly what the rating for this restaurant to be. Went there Sunday morning around lunch time and only had to wait roughly 25 minutes which is not bad for Charlotte for the time being. Once we sat down we were attended immediately and had our drinks and complimentary biscuit and blueberry preserves which are a little to hyped up by the other reviews I read prior to coming to the establishment because the blue berry preserves weren&#39;t really flavor able but the biscuit itself was soft and tasty. Ordered the fried green tomatoes which arrived in less than 5 minutes. Tomatoes were incredible since they say the on top of some goat cheese grits that had a mild sauce on it. I ordered the fried chicken and pancakes which was a first for me since I&#39;ve only ever heard of chicken and waffle. I had substituted the bacon for sausage since I don&#39;t like bacon( I know I&#39;m Un-American) which was layered on top of the pancake and on top of the sausage was that soft but crispy fried chicken. Too top it off all of these was covered with pecans which I thought was odd at first then realizing that I lack pecans in my regular breakfast entrées. The pancake itself tasted as if a Caucasian teenage female was reincarnated into a pumpkin and put in the pancake batter, not too sweet and not too Starbucks so it was perfect. My date had ordered the fried chicken and biscuits which she wasn&#39;t unsatisfied but she had wished that she had ordered one of the omelet a that were floating by the room. It was a lot to eat and we ended up getting to go boxes and a banana pudding to go because that&#39;s one of our favorite desserts. The banana pudding was delicious and wasn&#39;t to much were it made you fall into an instant food coma but the bananas and wafers tasted fresh even after we put in in the fridge for about 2 hours. In summary staff was excellent and nothing beats comforting southern breakfast so I would definitely go back and try the shrimp and grits.\"\n",

We continued to get our food which was DELICIOUS, especially the Brüssel sprouts. The bartender with the red hair then continued to check on us, but not with the same friendly energy as other guests, and very snotty and used language like &#34;what, huh&#34; in an i uninviting tone.

It came to the table and it was yellow which we all were like &#34;alright this could be cool, it&#39;s got bacon and other stuff in it. Anything with bacon is good, right?&#34; WRONG. This thing is made with like mustard or something and was super chunky and all three of us took a sip at the same time and got that sour puss face, and spit it out. Swing and a miss! Hate sending anything back but dear baby jesus it was bad. Server took care of us and got us 3 regular bloody marys and we were set.\"\n",

Atmosphere is wonderful. Complimentary biscuits and jam are amazing (and I don&#39;t care for biscuits). We were a party of 6 - three &#34;good&#34;, and three &#34;meh&#34;. Hush puppies were very, very salty. My Southern breakfast bowl was lukewarm at best, and just not that appealing. The goal cheese grits were great, though. Likewise for the chopped salad - lackluster, tough chicken, and so-so greens. The bacon (on any dish) is fabulous. Service was slammed, but our waiter apologized and brought us extra biscuits. Very nice craft beer selection. Will try again when it&#39;s not so busy.\"\n",

I ordered the garlic chicken which was very tasted and came with a side of Mac and cheese and veggies. The Mac and cheese wasn&#39;t the best I&#39;ve had, but was perfectly fine. Friends got the BBQ plate, which was tasty but needed more sauce. The fried okra was delicious!

It was too much after already eating another biscuit.<br><br>The bar had many taps including all the local players as well as microbrews.  I was working when I ate there so I didn&#39;t get to try a bloody mary, but hopefully I will make it back soon to try it out.<br><br>I know I mentioned Flying Biscuit a lot.  Really the two are quite different aside from the fact that both restaurants consider a biscuit to be their signature.\"\n",

Lowlight: overpriced. THC has got a nice/hipster/upscale country-diner feel to it. There are a lot of free-range and organic and gluten-free options on the menu (see hipster feel above)(they even carry Omission beer, for (1) those w gluten allergies and (2) those who don&#39;t understand gluten but avoid it anyway). But the food really is good. The blueberry jam (w biscuits), the fried shrimp (w basil and spicy aioli), and  the FRIED OKRA were my favorites. Part of the price is the organic, free-range, hormone-free thing, another part is the location. Portion size does help in this department though, you will have lunch for the next day.

Today, of course it wasn&#39;t. We were seated immediately. The atmosphere is quaint and cozy. Our server was a doll. She was new. We ordered a mimosa and a beer. She brought us out coffee and the drinks took a little longer than I would&#39;ve expected for just drinks. They put fresh, hot biscuits for each on your table with blueberry preserves. The biscuits were scrumptious! If you like goat cheese, every fuckin thing here  has it in it. I, of course I  am the odd ball who doesn&#39;t. They don&#39;t sub it out because it&#39;s already made with it. However, she brought me a little to try and it was actually very subtle, warm and creamy . Quite good, I must admit.I ordered Eggs Betty (Benedict) and Frank ordered a &#34;Scrambled Bowl&#34;. It looked liked eggs scrambled with Caramelized  onions, cheddar, bacon, and &#34;potato cracklings&#34;.  They&#39;re potatoes that are baked, smashed, seasoned and pretty good.  It came with toast that was only toasted on one side. My guess is that they&#39;re &#34;toasted&#34; on a flat top griddle and it tasted like it. My eggs were perfectly cooked, on top of a biscuit with a thick slice of bacon that I found to be a little tough and dry. Oh and my food was COLD. I sent it back and it was taken off the bill. Manager came over, apologized, and gave us a jar of strawberry preserves on him. Overall, it was a great experience and we definitely will try it again. I know this place didn&#39;t get great reviews for nothing . WE WILL BE BACK, TUPELO! Get ready!\"\n",

It took over 6 minutes for someone to even notice we had sat down, though we had been seated right next to the kitchen. When we were finally brought water my glass had food stuck to the inside of it. We ordered food and it took 35 minutes to get 2 sandwiches at 2 pm brunch on a Saturday. Unacceptable. Our server, though polite, clearly too busy. He apologized about the long wait for our food and offered desert. Food was prepared hurriedly and was awful. We ordered dessert to go since we had been there for almost an hour and a half (for again 2 brunch sandwiches) and they came out to the table not to go.  When stated we needed them to go we were told it would ruin the presentation. We asked for a box and packaged it our selves. Biggest waste of $55, at this point I wish we would have canceled our order and left. No manager ever came by. Awful and unacceptable. The issue could have been resolved but it was continued to be made worse. Very, very upset.\"\n",

The staff is very friendly and even with a packed house on two occasions, we still felt attended to, and our needs met.  (Once, I was on a time crunch of an hour, and despite a completely full bar area, our server made sure our food came out quickly, and our bill taken care off within that 60 minute window.) <br><br>Note:  No reservations taken under I believe it is 6 or 8 people.  Their first week they also didn&#39;t accept phone carry-out orders...you had to go in and order in person, and wait at the restaurant.  That was a bit irritating.<br><br>Note 2: Parking can be tricky during peak hours, (Liberty is in the same plaza, along with other businesses) so plan accordingly. <br><br>Bottom Line:  If you&#39;re a fan of the other locations...and enjoy their style of Southern cuisine, put this on your list.  It&#39;s a great go-to for Breakfast, lunch or dinner.

After waiting for around 10 mins to be helped, we were informed that our waiter did not know that he had a table. Since we had a enough time to decide what we wanted to eat, when we ordered they realized they had given us the brunch menu instead of the dinner menu. After ordering, we we&#39;re sitting in full view of the open kitchen and saw a man with the words &#34;chef&#34; on his hat, using a cell phone with gloves on and did not see him change his gloves before handling the food. We also observed that our entrees sat under the lamps on the counter for a while before they were brought out to us. But that&#39;s not all, they also only brought our main dish without the side and we were able to finish our sandwich before our side even reached the table. Although they comped our half price appetizer for making us wait, this still did not make up for our poor experience. Plus, we were maybe one of five tables in the dining room (the kitchen should not have been that behind) The food was delicious as always, but there is lots of room for improvement for service.\"\n",

We sat outside on the patio with great weather and enjoyed our drinks, his Bloody Mary and my Sparkling Blueberry Punch. We ordered the okra as an appetizer that came with a white BBQ sauce that was delicious and tangy. We ordered our entrees, he ordered the Pimento and Fried Pickle burger and I ordered the Crab Benedict. Our entrees came out and I was immediately surprised thinking that there would be a fair amount of Crab with mine and there was about a tablespoon scattered throughout the hollandaise sauce. The eggs, which should be poached with a runny yolk had runny whites and a fully cooked yolk. I talked to the waitress and she had them recook the plate. When the second plate came out, the Benedict looked a little better but when I cut into the yolk, it was again cooked all the way through. So I didn&#39;t want to complain again, I tried to eat the rest of my plate. The Crab and the hollandaise sauce were good, nothing spectacular. It also comes with potato cracklins which in my case was a roughly chopped potato and ended up being an entire half of potato that was not cooked all the way through. At that point, I gave up. The waitress did not come back to check on the second plate but proceeded to drop the check without saying anything. I tipped 20% because I&#39;m a waitress too and know it was not her fault that the food was wrong. I don&#39;t typically write reviews on restaurants, but this was bad enough that it warranted a review as well as a note left on the check. We will not be returning.\"\n",

Sweet Tea is the way a judge a restaurant that claims Southern heritage. Well the sweet tea is on point; taste like its sweetened with cane sugar and honey; a great beverage with a lil lemon sprinkle. Last but not least the biscuits.

After a brief but very cold winter and a few false starts, I felt like finally Spring was happening. The sun was shining, the temperature neared the 60s and the drive was easy.<br><br>Tupelo Honey Cafe is located on the second story of a slightly nondescript building. The first thing that I noticed was a crowd waiting for tables to open up on a beautiful porch. The wait I hear can be long but the owners have done a very fine job of making everyone comfortable. Have a seat on the large porch and let the perfect Spring breeze calm you as you wait.<br><br>Fortunately, I had reservations (you can make these via the Tupelo Honey Website). We were seated almost immediately. When you walk inside, you will notice the high ceilings and the bright feel of the place. I loved the exposed brick and wood along with an open kitchen. I felt the spacious outside carried over into the inside very well. The place was packed but I never felt crowded and could have a nice conversation with my brunch-mates.<br><br>Our waitress was friendly but not overly so and checked on us appropriately throughout our meal. After we ordered, she brought us each a warm buttermilk drop biscuit and a serving of Tupelo Honey&#39;s blueberry jam. It was delicious. I thought the jam was perfectly balanced but could have used a tad bit of lemon.<br><br>I ordered the Southern Fried Chicken BLT sandwich with tomato soup as a side. My husband ordered Fried Chicken and my friend ordered the Shoo Mercy Pancake. We received our food in a fairly quick amount of time considering how packed the dining room seemed to be. My tomato soup was spicy and sweet and well seasoned. My husband is decidedly not a tomato soup fan but enjoyed the few spoonfuls that I shared with him. The chicken sandwich was massive. Perched between two buttered buns, a generous slice of tomato and fresh green lettuce, sat a hand battered fried chicken breast. Also, the bacon was to die for - sweet and smokey. My husband loved his biscuits and gravy and his chicken he said was delicious. My friend seemed to be relishing her massive, fluffy pancake.<br><br>We had a wonderful experience at Tupelo Honey Cafe. I am certain that we will go back and try their dinner service sometime soon. Most of the time I roll my eyes when I see buzz words like &#34;New South Flavors&#34; but Tupelo Honey Cafe feels sincere in their attempts.\"\n",

            "9p1u4vQRYQXkoy4ZqiiQoQ,\"Biscuits and jam. &#39;Enough said. You get these served complimentary after you order. Delightfully fluffy yet filling in every bit. The jam will coat your teeth, it is so sugary sweet but tart! If ordering brunch I recommend switching out the home fries (which are delicious) for the sliced tomatoes (even more delicious) but a healthier choice. Perfect amount of food if you make this swap, otherwise you won&#39;t need to eat the rest of the day. Parking can be a pain if you go during Sunday or Saturday brunch, just go slow and be patient, you&#39;ll find a spot. Line always moves quicker then they say it will.\"\n",

            "oOky0_LAJBRoseJqlYFCuQ,\"We have finally found a honey of a restaurant in the Tupelo Honey Cafe on South Boulevard in Charlotte. You couldn&#39;t find a better general manager in Cedric Castro if you searched for years. He attends to every detail. And the highlight of our evening is when we request, no matter how long we have to wait, Iris our server. She is the epitome of professionalism, personality, and care. You have to love her. Once you meet her you&#39;ll see. And oh the menu... to die for. I had the buttermilk fried chicken with white gravy, moist and tender, and the smashed cauliflower. The homemade biscuits, jam and Tupelo Honey - it melts in your mouth. My son had the delicious hamburger, mac and cheese and fried okra. We also had the lamb meatballs with the special sauce as our appetizer and for dessert homemade banana pudding. Not just vanilla wafers stuck into instant pudding but the real bona fide thing. We have also met Cedric&#39;s assistant Mike, Chef Jason and his team of Turk, James, Kenny and the many more we will continue to meet as we are now happy regulars. Of course there&#39;s beer, wine and liquor and the restaurant&#39;s architecture is simply beautiful. John Schoeni and John Jr.\"\n",

They were very accommodating to our party of 14, celebrating a graduation when we arrived late due to bad timing on our part in regard to the light rail schedule from UNCC. Our server Darius was very friendly. The bartender must have been slammed as drink service was super slow and the cocktail presentations were VERY inconsistent. Second round of Madame Beauregarde - Blueberry-Basil Martini had no garnishes was the color was downright scary - a pepto pink. The first Mojito Du Jour was delicious and refreshing but the second one was served in a much smaller glass and had the same tinge of pepto pink as the second Madame Beauregarde. The food was ok. The fried green tomatoes were obviously out of season but grits were divine. The portion of the Pimento Cheese Nachos was just enough to make you hangry. The biscuits were fantastic and the blueberry compote so amazing my BIL bought a jar. My salad was good, hard to mess up a bowl of lettuce. The fried chicken on top was tasty. Biggest complaint however was lack of clean up after appetizers and two rounds of beverages. Of all the restaurants in Charlotte it will be awhile before I will head here again - hopefully things will improve.\"\n",

There&#39;s something for everyone. We sat near the kitchen and dang near everything that was set on that counter looked delicious. <br><br>But let&#39;s talk service first. Our server&#39;s name was Brittany and she was amazing! She greeted us shortly after we sat down, our drinks were never empty and she came back several times to make sure everything was ok. I&#39;d like to add that she did all this and provided excellent service on a packed Saturday night while people were on town for Pride. I say that because sometimes in places service tends to suffer when servers are overwhelmed with tables and all. Brittany handled it like a champ and never dropped the ball or let us see her sweat lol. Of course her most difficult task was asking if we wanted dessert even bough I&#39;m sure my tummy looked like it was ready to explode lol. I was tempted. It next time I will for sure try something because I saw a few leave the kitchen and they looked divine. Anyways I&#39;d certainly go back and ask for Brittany. She takes care of the customers.<br><br>They give you a biscuit before your meal with a side of some blueberry jam. The biscuit is really soft, warm and flaky. I don&#39;t even like biscuits but I would go and order just those if I could. I ordered the Salted Roasted Beets w/ Pecan crusted goat cheese. It was good but for $9 I expected a few more beets on the plate. For my main meal, I ordered the Wampus Cat Ribs w/ Apple Cider Greens &amp; Baked Mac and sampled some of the meatloaf off my sweety&#39;s plate. The meatloaf was okay. Not really my style with the tomato salsa on top (I prefer a gravy or glaze) but it wasn&#39;t bad. My ribs though... were DELICIOUS! They had a kick of spiciness to them, very meaty and tender the way a rib should be. The greens were good and there was a good serving on the plate. My mac &amp; cheese was also really good. Probably one of the few restaurants I&#39;ve been to in the Carolinas that makes a proper mac and actually BAKES it, not that stovetop crap. Normally I don&#39;t like the bread crumbs on top but this was really good and cheesy and so I didn&#39;t mind so much. <br><br>Overall, I would definitely go back to sample some more of their goodies (porkchops, scallops, peach ribs, pulled pork) and more sides too (they need a veggie plate lol). Food: A.   Service: A+\"\n",

The beer menu was decent enough, so we both decided on a beer.  Ten to fifteen minutes later, our two beers arrive and they were quickly followed by a biscuit and blueberries. The biscuit was good, albeit room temperature.  We elected the chicken wings to start- they were quite good, both in size and flavor. I was even more excited for my meal! <br><br>I ordered the buttermilk fried shrimp, the french green beans in brown butter with basil and the parmesan shoestring fries with BBQ seasoning.  My boyfriend opted for the meat loaf with benne asparagus and mac-n-cheese.  My first bite was a crispy shoestring fry...... Not one shaving of parm on the pile of slivered potatoes. Not a lick of BBQ season on a single fry on the plate.  Not even a grain of salt! My brown butter green beans with basil had no basil, no salt, no brown butter, and no flavor.  They tasted like canola oil and the green beans you steam in the bag.  The jumbo buttermilk fried shrimp had the ability to be quite tasty. Unfortunately they decided to squirt lemon mayo all over the five shellfish I received. Aioli it was not.  They could have at least used Dukes.  The mac-n-cheese tasted like boiled pasta.  Unsalted boiled pasta, the same consistency of Stouffers but less flavor. The asparagus was to be &#34;benne asparagus.&#34; We found and counted ONE single sesame seed on his plate.  The meatloaf was as cold as the seedless asparagus.<br><br>I like beer. Especially when I go out.  I can run up a bar tab.  Not an issue here. My beer glass sat empty as did my water, and not once was I offered more of either beverage. <br><br>I will not be returning.  Next time I want southern flavor and don&#39;t feel like cooking it myself, I&#39;ll go back to the Cajun Yard Dog. Those folks know how to do it right, and they are deliciously consistent.\"\n",

            "pCBDx3P-Y7lOGZVZbi9YqA,\"I love this place. My fiance and I took a weekend getaway to Charlotte for a little R&amp;R. We searched on google for a good place to get brunch on a Saturday and Tupelo had the best reviews. We stayed at the Westin, it was about a 10 minutes Uber drive. Since it was around 1 pm on a Saturday it was packed. We had to wait about 40 minutes to get a seat, so we took a walk around the block since it was a beautiful day. We finally were seated the tables was a little small, but we&#39;re from Pittsburgh and have a breakfast spot here Pamela&#39;s with the same setup, so it was okay for us. We took a look at the menu and my fiance and I both decided to order the sweet potatoes pancakes with a fried chicken breast, apple cider vinegar bacon, walnuts, butter, syrup and powder sugar on top. The waiter came out with two biscuits with some jam, the best biscuits I ever had, very moist and buttery. He came out with our plates.  I was in love from the first bite. The sweet potatoes pancake was very sweet and moist, the chicken was fried to perfection, and the bacon was very crispy, it all came together well. We left with a smile on our face, we walked back to the hotel we talked about our meal all the way there. The next time I&#39;m in Charlotte we will make a return.\"\n",

On a scale from 0-10, I would give it a 7, not bad but nothing special either. The side of macaroni cheese I got is about a 5 on a scale of 0-10. To me, it doesn&#39;t taste like baked macaroni cheese, but more like macaroni in cheese sauce. Would I go back? Absolutely not.

I picked my side of goat cheese grits. Everything was pretty good. I wasn&#39;t a fan of the lemony hollandaise, but that&#39;s just a personal preference.

While service at the bar was slow our food was reasonable in timing. Matt was keeping us informed about what was going on. Our waters were always filled. The small plate of shrimp mac and cheese absolutely loved it, it is worth the carbs. The market fish (Corvina) with garlic risotto and tomatoes excellent, the balsamic flavor I believe it was on the tomatoes I could have done without. However, still good. My other two dining pals got the salmon and curried fried chicken. Salmon was gone, i saw the plate get there and i saw it empty moments later thats about it. Curried fried chicken, the pieces of chicken were rather small would have prefer one more piece and less sides. It was still delicious.

I ordered the Salmon(Grilled) was served with carrot and kale slaw with avocado lime vinaigrette.  I also ordered the Appalachian Corn Soufflé.  William came back to our table with David and they shared with me that the Soufflé was not dairy free. I was so impressed by the professionalism and detail to my dietary need.  David said he would make me String Beans with Garlic.  This most definitely should be on the menu! The string beans were flavorsome.  It was an explosion in my mouth.  First, you have the crispiness of the beans, next the fresh basil ribbon, the sweetness of the garlic, and the garlic oil left us talking about throughout the meal.  I shared with my new colleague.  The Salmon was so very fresh, very light, grilled to perfection.  This is the best meal I have had in Charlotte.  William, our waiter was so very accommodating, amazing service, and a pleasure to speak with. My colleague had Fried Chicken Salad.  He said it was delicious.  After our meal, I visited with David and shared with him this was by far &#34;The Best Honey Tupelo&#39;s&#34;.  He visited our table one more time and I asked what was the secret to the string beans.  He said with smile, it was a secret.  We thanked him and William brought our check.  We left with a big smile!  We were walking to our car and we see David runs to us.  He caught up to us in the parking lot and presented me with this beautiful cookbook based on the recipes and secrets of Honey Tupelo.  I was really taken back.  All I can say is make this priority and visit them both.  I would definitely ask for William the server.  Say hello to David, he definitely made my day!  This truly is the &#34;VERY BEST HOSPITALITY&#34;!!!\"\n",

            "sctqJ9T8FckUrxdatHdO5A,\"I really wanted to like this place, because all my friends had been and they seemed to like it. I give this place name the &#34;fake southern food&#34;. <br><br>We arrived at 5, parking is to say the least difficult.  At 5pm we were told it was an hour wait. So I spotted two seats at the bar and snagged them. I asked the bartender if we could eat there and she told us yes.  I ordered the tupelo honey draft, which was great.  Since I was sitting at the bar you would think the service would be great... Not so. She couldn&#39;t be bothered with us when I asked what was the best thing on the menu.. She simply said it&#39;s all good..(I don&#39;t think she&#39;s even eaten the food here) we ordered the okra to start. The okra came out pretty fast. I love fried okra, however this was wormy tasting mushy and not at all crisp on the inside. Fail. Won&#39;t try it again. Since it was so bland I was hesitant to order dinner and we thought about going some place else. It was filling up in the place the bar barely had standing room, and people were pushing and shoving. Some man came over and asked me if the seat next to me was taken and I said no he proceeded to shove another seat in next to me. If you&#39;ve been there the bar area itself is small, an extra seat doesn&#39;t fit well.  Then the man asked to try my okra! Sure since I was done with it now.. And still waiting to order. Weird.   <br><br>We got veggie plate and tomato soup and grill cheese. When it finally came, it looked ok. The grill cheese is just grilled cheese on big toast. Bland at best. The tomato soup was barely warm, no worries though because the five people tending bar couldn&#39;t be bothered to even ask. The veggie plate with Mac and cheeses, beets, and some kind of roasted collard greens was absolutely nasty. The beets were not cooked. Think raw beet dipped in some kind of vinegar sweet juice.. The collards were terrible not even cooked. And I didn&#39;t bother tasting the Mac and cheese.  My husband said it was ok. But if your in this area of town looking for southern food I suggest skip this over rated place and head to midnight dinner or macs speed shop. Unless of course you just want beer and crowds. <br><br>On one other note the guys next to us asked for a couple shots the bartender lady said well this isn&#39;t really a bar bar, if you want that you need find just a bar.. Indicating she had no clue how to mix this shot they wanted which was just pickle juice and Irish whiskey.. Seriously not hard and all she had to do was google it which they did for her. <br><br>I&#39;m not going to bother going back here. The service was sub par, the food was worse. Try it if you want to wait 1 hr or more at any time of day and want just say you&#39;ve been to the new hip trendy place in town. Cheers.\"\n",

While others boast poor service, we had quite the opposite. Our server was attentive, checking on us at just the right intervals. Waters never ran empty, and he was kind in his approach.<br>We started with a pimento cheese appetizer. Honestly, this didn&#39;t taste like any pimento I&#39;ve ever had and not in a good way. The flavor was lacking, and there was a heavy granular texture. The pickled jalapeno went well with it, but I would have liked that taste to be incorporated into the cheese instead of on the side. The chips were overly salted, which also muted my taste buds to any flavor the cheese might have had.<br>Served alongside the appetizer was a corn meal biscuit with warm honey and blueberry jam. While the biscuit was a bit dry, the honey compensated for this. The blueberry lacked in sweetness, but this was actually a plus side. It also paired well.<br>I had the Charleston Chicken sandwich, which was decent. The bread was a little over-buttered, but other than that the chicken was moist and the Havarti cheese was a perfect choice. On the side was the lemon quinoa, which was overpowered by the extremely ripe blueberries. If I had a bite without a blueberry, it was perfect. An odd note, but if the blueberries hadn&#39;t been so ripe they would have worked nicely.<br>My partner had the Fried Chicken BLT. Honestly, it needed a bit more of the honey dijon as the flavor in the chicken was muted by the bread and tomato. The chicken alone (out of the sandwich) was extremely tasty. The breading was on point and the chicken was moist. However, his side item (the Southern Style Greens) should have been labeled &#39;Chinese beef and broccoli.&#39; Of course there was no beef, but the greens were so thoroughly swamped in sauce (a soy base I took it) that any flavor that the greens had themselves was lost long ago. <br><br>All in all, I might go back every few months. I definitely wouldn&#39;t get the same thing, as their dinner entrees looked more appealing after all was said and done. Not a favorite spot of mine, but not terrible by any stretch. Seems like a nice place in good weather to sit outside, have a Happy Hour drink, and enjoy a small app or split an entree.\"\n",

All their food was well thought out and different while still sticking to tradition. I could hardly decide what to get; I was stuck on three or four options that all sounded delicious (so I&#39;ll be going back soon). I ended up getting the loaded grilled cheese with tomato basil soup and a side of grits. I&#39;m so happy I didn&#39;t pass on the goat cheese grits- they were fantastic!

When we arrived, only 4 of the 6 were there, so we were sent to the bar to wait. When the other members arrived just a few minutes later, we were told that the wait would be 30 min even though we had a reservations. Fine. Whatever. We had a good place at the very tiny bar. One plus was that the bar service was very prompt and friendly even though it&#39;s typically packed shoulder to shoulder.<br><br>Thirty minutes came and passed, and when I asked about our reservation, they said 15 more minutes. When I asked after 15 minutes, they said 15 more....This went on for AN HOUR AND A HALF. Why we waited, I&#39;m not really sure. At that point it was probably principle more than anything.<br><br>I finally had to stand at the hostess station with the manager for her to figure out they had given a party of TWO with the same name our table over an hour ago and had been trying to save face ever since. Complete idiots never even told me (which I wouldn&#39;t have been super understanding, but still, at least it was an excuse). The manager was completely rude and unapologetic for their mistakes.<br><br>After much back and forth, we were seated TWO AND A HALF HOURS after we first arrived (which was two hours and 15 minutes after our reservation time). Luckily, our food was comped, but I want my life back that I wasted at that restaurant. <br><br>Incompetent hostesses and management.

            "cpkkojfuNh4zaXHvgDZoMw,\"I have no idea why THC has 3.5 stars. I&#39;d like to think of this review as 4.5.<br><br>Let me preface this with the disclaimer: THC is pretty expensive. There&#39;s a lot of reasons why - it&#39;s a chain from asheville, they&#39;re in south end, etc. But they also serve some pretty amazing food so I&#39;d still consider it worth it.<br><br>I&#39;ve been to THC 3 times, and I consider that enough to be able to rate its consistency. Portion sizes are generous, the biscuits + blueberries are TO DIE FOR, and the menu has a solid mix of old and new. Some notes on tastes for those who are wondering what to order:<br><br>* The greens are heavy on the soy, and are kale rather than traditional southern choices like mustard or collards. I enjoyed them but I consider them a poor departure from tradition. Lola&#39;s greens are far superior<br>* The grits use goat cheese. Of course it says this on the menu but if you&#39;re used to gouda in your grits keep it in mind. Personally I&#39;m going to put goat in my next batch if I get a chance.<br>* The nut chicken is supposedly a fan favorite but when their traditional batter is so incredibly fantastic I don&#39;t see why you&#39;d do it.<br>* The meatloaf was recommended to me over the chicken piccata which was a disappointment. Personally I think there could be a lot more here - the mushroom gravy used on other dishes would go MUCH better with it than the watery tomato one they throw on.<br>* Get the chicken piccata. Seriously. Don&#39;t ask, just do it.<br><br>Service has been excellent so far. We had one hiccup with an incredibly long serving time for their top-of-the-line margarita. Turns out they were short staffed at the bar and our server had to cut some of the vegetables. Plus it was missing the shrimp it was supposed to have : (<br><br>When I get the check I always sigh a little because I have to tip at least 20% on top of a $35+ tab (poor me right?) but then I sign it anyway because THC is a great place to go for high end southern.\"\n",

At least when asked, he eventually filled the glasses, coffee and served the table. Frankly, don&#39;t quit your day job, or try to learn your craft.<br>The biscuits were ok, a bit small and over seasoned. The honey was nothing to talk about, although the side blueberry jelly seemed homemade or was a reasonable facsimile. It was a nice touch to provide 1 per person free in lieu of bread.<br>The execution of the entrees were rather pedestrian and over priced. The table ordered the chicken and biscuits topped with an egg and ham pieces. The egg was cooked as ordered and the Chicken piece ( yes, it was almost a finger, but slightly bigger) was ok. The Ham pieces could have been freeze dried and overall, it wasn&#39;t worth the price. The other dish was the hanger steak and eggs which was originally served cold and had to be returned. After re-presentation by a manager ( no compensation offered for the inconvenience... Yes, table parties eating alone) the steak was paltry, less than 2 oz but cooked as ordered. Eggs made as ordered and potatoes served as crackles, another code word for fried. <br>Overall, not a place to go out of the way for and certainly overpriced for serving size.

I was very excited to bring a group of co-workers with me. We waited 20 minutes for a seat but since we arrived during the lunch rush, we were patient. Just as before the biscuits, jam &amp; honey were amazing but unfortunately that was the extent of my good experience. We waited a long time for our food (we&#39;re at about an hour in at this point) and once it came so did the requests. Mayo, dressing for a friends salad, etc. our waitress seemed young and a bit inexperienced to handle multiple requests as she would bring one item out at a time. After my burger sat getting cold for another 10 minutes I asked again for mayo and was told &#34;it&#39;s coming!&#34;. At that point I&#39;m losing my appetite because of her attitude and service but it was my birthday lunch after all so I was going to enjoy this burger....or was I? Nope, my med well burger was med RARE at best once I cut into it and at that point the rest of my party was more than 1/2 way through their meal. I was done. The manager said she would comp my meal, give me a gift card (which she never gave me) and bring me something else from the menu but seemed like she honestly didn&#39;t care that my birthday lunch was ruined...and they still brought me the check for the &#34;comped&#34; grilled cheese sandwich I had to choke down. <br><br>This did not seem like the same place I had dinner opening weekend. Had it only been issues with the food &amp; had I not been disrespected by the staff, I might have returned once they get the kinks worked out. <br><br>Tip: the wood floors are EXTREMELY slippery (hold the wax, folks) and an elderly lady fell flat on her back while we were there.

We also tried their pimento cheese dip with tortillas and the cheese was more like a cheese dip with pimento flavor. It was good, but I would recommend getting the fried green tomatoes for sure. <br>I had the veggie melt with no mushrooms and it was delicious, it didn&#39;t have a top piece of bread to it which I actually kind of enjoyed because it wasn&#39;t too much bread but rather about the vegetables. It was def. the kind of sandwich you eat with a knife and fork! As my side item I had the fried green tomatoes and they were delicious!

So when they opened in Charlotte I was excited to be able to try it. Unfortunately this was my first and last visit.<br><br>The service was awful. Before I proceed, I should mention there were many empty tables and booths. We waited for a long time to just get menus. Another lengthy wait before we could order. The food came fairly fast though. The waiter didn&#39;t ask if we needed anything, just sat the food down and walked away. My boyfriend ordered a burger with fries, so he wanted ketchup. It was impossible to get the attention of the 5 servers standing behind the bar talking, so I had to get up and get ketchup off an unbussed table. <br><br>While we ordered another table was seated next to us. By the time we got our food they still had not received menus. After I got my own ketchup one of them walked up to the front of the restaurant and picked up her own menus.<br><br>The food was pretty tasty. The biscuits with honey and jam were a great little appetizer.  I was told the burger was good, as was the veggie sandwich I ordered. We sat with empty plates for a lengthy time, unable to get a bartender or server to notice us. It took forever for someone to ask if we wanted anything else or just the check. We probably would have ordered another beer, but the restaurant missed out on that. Instead we asked for our check, which again took forever. We left full, but not willing to come back. <br><br>There were so many servers hanging around talking,they were clearly overstaffed. Maybe they would be more attentive to paying customers if there was less time to chat. I honestly think we could have walked away without paying and no one would have noticed. Maybe the Asheville location has better service, but with the abundance of good food in Asheville, they will unfortunately never get my business.\"\n",

We got here about 600 on Friday night, which was just in time to beat the big crowds.  Service was extremely attentive and prompt. <br>I ordered my 4 year old daughter a grilled cheese sandwich and fruit along with our apps and she literally ate the entire plate of food, plus a biscuit, which is very unusual! I can only assume it was great!! And those biscuits. Soooooo yummy. Flaky and buttery and hot!! I could have eaten 10! They may be my favorite biscuit from a restaurant. Fried green tomatoes were nice; I&#39;m not really a connoisseur of these so will defer to others, I thought they were good but only the second time I&#39;ve ever eaten them. For dinner, I got the crab cakes, which looked a little bready, so I was concerned, but were delicious with lots of crab. They had a hard crust vs most with a soft crust, but I liked them a lot. And the Swiss chard and asparagus mix on the side was yummy. I wished there were more of it. I tried my husband&#39;s pulled pork and it was super yummy and a HUGE portion. We had a table of 8 and everyone seemed very happy with their food. We eat out a lot so we will definitely be back. <br><br>One piece of advice, we ordered so many apps that we were totally full after entrees. Next time I will skip some so we can try the desserts!<br><br>Only downer is parking but I can&#39;t knock the restaurant for that. The parking sucks though. Be prepared to walk a block unless you want to run up your blood pressure looking for a space in the tiny adjacent lot.\"\n",

We looked for a similar option, and thought of Tupelo Honey. We had heard great things about their brunch, but it was already 8:00 pm so we decided to go for dinner instead.  Parking was available but not convenient, and when we realized we had to climb stairs we almost just walked to Nan and Byrons. Nonetheless, we ended up sticking with the original plan and before we knew it the two of us were sitting at a table with four chairs (all of the booths were occupied). <br><br>Did our waitress know the menu? Yes.  Could she pair drinks with dishes? Yes, but only because the menu did it for her. I looked at the beer menu, and nothing really caught my attention, so I asked for a tap water, lite on the ice with an orange slice. My wife asked for the same, and the waitress was back momentarily with two waters, each containing 3 ice cubes and an orange slice and a plate of biscuits with a delicious honey spread.  <br><br>Took a glance at the appetizers, and nothing was appealing.  We love fried red tomatoes, and order them whenever we can.  However, we DO NOT eat tomatoes before they are ripe. That ruled out the fried green tomatoes.  The Appalachian Shrimp were tempting, but we decided against them as we had never tried fresh water shrimp before. We asked the waitress for her recommended entrees, and she described the Carolina Mountain Trout.  We had been eyeing this item before, but her description made it sound TERRIBLE.  We almost left, but it was already 8:40 and Nan and Byrons seemed like quite the hike.  After another quick glance at the menu, I ordered two Fried Chicken and Biscuits plates before the waitress could ruin them for us.  We already knew we liked the restaurant&#39;s biscuits, and we figured its pretty difficult to mess up fried chicken.  We were right! The chicken was very above average, as was the gravy that accompanied it.  There were ups and downs during our visit to Tupelo Honey, but chicken and biscuits were delectable.\"\n",

Our waitress was very friendly and really helped us with our questions about the menu. I ordered the fried chicken BLT with a side of goat cheese grits. Those were the cheesiest grits I have EVER had, very delicious! The Fried Chicken BLT was very moist but lacked a little flavor for me. The bacon had way too much fat on it, I had to remove from my sandwich. My boyfriend had the chicken wings appetizer, and for a appetizer those were some pretty big wings! The sauce on the wings had a little spicy kick but still sweet. The chicken seemed to be double breaded which gave that extra crunch we like. We also ordered a side of the homemade Mac n cheese, this was not as cheesy as I would have liked. I can say there was nothing special about the Mac n cheese. The homemade biscuits they give you are so buttery and warm, and awesome with the blueberry jam! We will try this place again for breakfast.\"\n",

We were seated on the porch upon arrival after being offered inside or outside (it was a tad noisy inside). It&#39;s really nice out there on the porch even with the road noise from South Blvd. It felt a little &#34;vacation-y&#34; with the string lights and breeze, and I enjoyed a glass of wine while I was waiting for my husband to park the car and get to the table. We had the fried green tomato appetizer, which comes over goat cheese grits. The green tomatoes were very good...not the least bit greasy, and the grits were quite tasty, although they needed a little bit of salt. I ordered an Uptown grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup for my entree. The grilled cheese was VERY cheesy. If you like a lot of cheese you&#39;ll love it. The bread was perfectly toasted and the tomato soup was truly yummy. Dip your grilled cheese in the soup, mmmm...  My husband had the catfish and it came over more grits. He said his catfish was nice and light with a little Cajun spice to it, but he was tired of the grits from our appetizer and didn&#39;t eat them, and that was the only side other than some salsa, which he also passed on. I would have put the salsa over the grits if it had been my dinner, but he&#39;s a pretty picky eater. They bring homemade biscuits to the table along with warm honey and blueberry jam. Even if you&#39;re cutting back on bread, that&#39;s worth making an exception. The biscuits had a perfect crust. Our waitress was in training and she did a superb job of taking care of us.

            "y2T3FPC5BQgZ_C9IvhoTtg,\"I don&#39;t know what is up with Charlotte lately, but this will be my second bad review in a week. My husband and I came here on Sunday for brunch. Having been to the Asheville location he was excited to try this one. I have been to this location once with my girlfriends and knew that there would obviously be a wait. When we arrived sure enough there was a 35-40 minute wait. Okay sounds fine and we were informed that we could sit in the bar if a table opened up. As luck would have it (or so we thought) a table opened up! Sure! Take our beeper for our table! We already have one in the bar area! BIG MISTAKE! After waiting about 15 minutes to get someone&#39;s attention we were finally able to get some water and coffee. At the same time we ordered our food as we didn&#39;t know when we would e able to get her again. However, there was no sugar and after going to the bar several times and telling our waitress it finally arrived about ten minutes later. Just in time to have my coffee be cold before even tasting it. So, 25 minutes to enjoy a coffee. And we waited for our food.... And waited.... And waited.... All during this time to see other people who were seated after us in the bar area enjoy their food. After trying to get our waitress&#39; attention (looking directly at us and us about to speak she literally would ignore us and go onto the next table! Not even acknowledge that we needed anything!) when we finally got her attention (after sitting down for an hour and about 50 minutes or so since we ordered our food) we asked her where our food was. She said the kitchen was backed up yada yada yada. But, if that was the case how come at least two other tables before us were served promptly and AFTER we had sat down. About an hour and 20 minutes after sitting down we got our food and basically not even an apology or wanting to comp so much as our coffee. It got so bad that my husband and I were about to walk out right before they sat our food down. It takes a lot for my husband to be upset with service to not come back somewhere and to be honest I don&#39;t know if we will ever come back to this location... At least not for Sunday brunch.\"\n",

We requested a high chair  &amp; when we were given a high chair it had visible food on the seat that we had to remove. Apparently the high chairs are not cleaned after usage. <br>We were given biscuits doughy and nothing special. Blackberry jam had a nice taste. <br>I order the black bean burger (paid extra for cheese), with a side of asparagus. <br>The plate came with the burger and asparagus swimming in sesame oil. The asparagus was not edible due to the sesame oil. All you tasted was oil when you bit into the asparagus.  The black bean burger was ok the bun was toasted prior to being placed on my plate but the bottom became soggy quickly with he oil. The pimento cheese that I paid extra for didn&#39;t even cover the burger it was maybe a half a tablespoon of cheese.  <br><br>My husband had a burger he said based on his meal he wouldn&#39;t come back.  You would think you could get a burger right... Charging extra for cheese come on! <br><br>Charlotte needs new &amp; different restaurants but this is not it. This restaurant is very similar to the restaurant Toast but more expensive.  <br><br>Recommendation drive a little further down the street and eat at Luna&#39;s Living Kitchen organic, vegan, fresh for the same price!\"\n",

As a vegetarian, I typically order their veggie burger and it is one of the best I have ever eaten. Their menu recently changed and I don&#39;t like that, but they still have some of the good original menu items. Also, their sweet potato pancakes are delicious!

It was their first Friday night. We enjoyed a nice bottle of Cabernet at a reasonable price and found a seat in the bar in about 15 minutes. The service was impeccable, the food was somewhere between average and below, yes it was ...we are very sorry to say. We tried the Pimento Cheese dip appetizer which was pretty good but the chips were not. At best the chips were the ones you do not pick up in the grocery. My guy had the meatloaf which was somewhat dry, way over salted. His mac and cheese was just okay. I had the black bean burger, it was fine...not great, not awful. I ordered the greens for a side which tasted as if they had been sauteed in lard, perhaps rancid lard. We will go back for drinks because everyone was so nice, but we are both pretty sure we will not dine there again unless things change. All of this for an easy $80.00 is a little tough to swallow in Dilworth where we have so many other good choices.\"\n",

My husband had the porterhouse pork chop, which he said was &#34;just ok.&#34; Dessert was also just ok.

He ordered the Mexican type omelet with chorizo and I ordered my standard sweet potato pancake with fried chicken. We were not impressed with the new menu at all, as an aside. When our food came out, my BF&#39;s omelet was barely warm on the outside and the inside was chilled salsa and chorizo. He told our server who took it away. They were going to just serve him another but we decided to split my entree instead. The petite blonde manager came over and apologized and we got lots of apologies but I was surprised and disappointed that the bill wasn&#39;t entirely comped due to a very poor and ruined dining experience. This is probably our 8th time dining here and we had a birthday celebration of 6 guests once. We will not return. The service is spotty, the food is inconsistent and management seems unconcerned with serious lapses without any effort to turn a bad experience into a positive one.  Mistakes and errors happen EVERYWHERE...these are OPPORTUNITIES to turn something bad into a positive experience. Tupelo Honey really needs some more training of managers on how to do this. When customers don&#39;t return and tell others of bad experiences, it is not a good thing for a business.\"\n",

My wife also indicated that the one in Asheville served the food with a signature flower, but none was offered at this location. The food was very good all in all. But, the coffee was absolutely horrible! When I told the waitress that it was incredibly strong (I mean unbelievably so!) and bitter, she explained that it was a Peruvian blend and even she, who liked strong coffee, couldn&#39;t handle what they served. This is ridiculous. This restaurant needs to offer a more subtle blend. I doubt most people would like their coffee.
