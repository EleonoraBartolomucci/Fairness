My date had the enchiladas with steak and he ate it all and said it was good. So I'll take his word. I also had the red sangria and it was good and not light on the alcohol - super bonus. I would probably return again but would try something different. I wish they didn't only use shredded chicken/beef though the best Mexican dishes I've had used breast/chunks. for some reason shredded never does the trick.
