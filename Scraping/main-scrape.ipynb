I had the chicken flautas and they were ok....a little dry but nothing a little salsa did not fix. My friend had the chicken quesadillas and I tried them.....now they were reqlly good....would recommend.

Take your money to a real business that provides quality product. Not worth your health.'), (54, \"Went here on a date and it was pretty good. The staff/servers are awesome and the made in front of you guacamole is sooo good. I had the chimichangas and they were kind of bland, I've had way better and I wish there was more sauce on it. I tried both the beef and chicken and neither were remarkable, but I ate it. I think my sour cream was spoiled or something because it tasted off. I think another review has mentioned that as well. My date had the enchiladas with steak and he ate it all and said it was good. So I'll take his word. I also had the red sangria and it was good and not light on the alcohol - super bonus. I would probably return again but would try something different. I wish they didn't only use shredded chicken/beef though the best Mexican dishes I've had used breast/chunks. for some reason shredded never does the trick.

Without a doubt this is the BEST margaritas I've ever had in my life. Me and my friends ordered the Mango, Passion Fruit, Guava and Watermelon and they are all too good to believe. If they were to be in a margarita graduation, this would definitely be the valedictorian. Guava is a MUST! In regards to food, we ordered the Chicken Flautas as appetizers and WOW there are no words to explain how good these were. Everything, from the service to the food and drinks were great. It's not the classiest of places, but that's exactly what sets the mood. Such an authentic Mexican place! Already planning my next NYC trip just so I can try out more dishes!\"), (58, 'It was a great Mexican restaurant, good food and great drinks. Service is fast and very friendly. Will recommend to go.'), (59, 'Festively decorated, colorful Mexican restaurant with good solid food. \\xa0We had guacamole \\xa0made fresh at the table followed by nachos which were on the skimpy side. \\xa0For the main course we had a burrito and enchiladas suizas. \\xa0They both had fresh ingredients and were well seasoned. \\xa0 I especially liked the coffee. \\xa0 It had a robust flavor without a burnt taste.'), (60, 'Best Margaritas & the Guacamole is perfection!'), (61, 'Came here with my handsome \\xa0boyfriend for some authentic mexican food! We usually browse Yelp and make a list of places we want to check out, and this was one of the places on the list! LOL.'), (62, 'Great place to get your margarita fix!'), (63, \"This is probably going to become my new favorite location to grab margaritas for happy hour! The staff was super friendly and was making sure I had nothing but a great time. The meals were flavorful and the drinks were strong enough to get this on a rant about any and everything under the sun! I can't speak highly enough about how cheap and strong the drinks were during happy hour and allowing myself to feel a real buzz only 15 minutes into my time there. If you're looking for a nice, clean and friendly location to get Mexican food and drinks, please stop by!! \"), (64, \"They give you chips and salsa!! Salsa was spicy though, caught my girlfriend off guard (she's real). Great fresh guacamole and a fantastic vegetarian fajita. We had a good time and she will definitely go back.\"), (65, 'Ambiance: this is a casual Mexican restaurant that would be perfect for families, casual dates, or just grabbing food w/ friends! There is also outdoor seating for those interested.'), (66, 'Margaritas:'), (67, 'This place is awesome. Great authentic Mexican food. Not like others in the area where they portray to be authentic Mexican restaurants and are not. Came in here with my girlfriend and had a great time. Not only did we enjoy the food but they actually had a guitar musician that asked us if we had any special request. It was pretty awesome! They are very attentive to you at all times as well. There are several Mexican restaurants on 2nd Avenue in this area, but this place is a gem and is far superior than the others. Without a doubt, this place is 5 stars!'), (68, 'Happened by and stopped in for dinner! Tiny place, colorful Mexican decor, great happy hour prices, white fabric tablecloths, quick service and delicious food!!! \\xa0All good, a bit overpriced for Mexican but worth it!'), (69, \"This restaurant has become the hands down favorite Mexican go-to place for my wife and I. The staff is always nice and very attentive, especially Jenny (we somehow get her every time we go lol). The food is delicious (my favorite is the fajita torito). And if you go during happy hour the margaritas are just $6! I don't care who you are, that's a great price!!\"), (70, 'After a long, got, summer day, their tall frozen flavored margaritas were the perfect pick me up, strong and sweet and delivered on fire . The chips were good, salsa deliciously spicy, and the nachos and quesadillas we ordered for the table well flavored and none too greasy. The chips struggled to hold up under the weight of all of the toppings, and by the end were falling apart, is my only judgement.'), (71, 'Came here for my birthday. Arrived with husband, dad and sister. I had two large bouquets of flowers which I asked to be placed in water. No water? Okay, please place them on the side. Nowhere to place them? Ok (father took the flowers and ran to his car two blocks away to hold them there while we ate). Moving on... we had ordered the table side guacamole. Nice flavor, spicy (but you can request spiciness level). I ordered the Black Bean Soup. Hubby ordered skirt steak fajitas. Sister ordered the same but vegetarian and pops ordered the Pollo con Limon (lemon chicken). Dad\\'s chicken was nice and lemony and it tasted better than it looked. Nice tender breast. Hubby\\'s and sisters fajitas came on a sizzling cast iron platter. Delicious! Hubbys only complaint was that the steak could have been sliced into strips to more easily be wrapped in the tortillas. Otherwise its like large 2x4\\'s that you have to chomp through. My black bean soup was a bit watery and underwhelming. The onions were still raw. But then I decided to wait for it to cool down and \"cook\" through a bit. This significantly improved it! I added the grated cheese that came with it on the side and voila! it was tasty.

They had a lunch happy hour special for drinks (I think around $6). I got their chicken quesadilla and kiwi margarita. \"), (77, 'Great guacamole and fajitas! Customer service was great. Anddd they have happy hour until 7pm :)..'), (78, 'I ended up here based on my location and Yelp reviews.'), (79, 'hair in burrito. curly black hair in my burrito. do not order from here unless you love eating hair.'), (80, 'Fixed to order, tasty, Mexican food with a modern flair. Allergies are taken serious. Food preferences are creatively combined with the standard menu items. '), (81, 'Stopped by with my husband for drinks and lunch. Drinks are good. Didn\\'t care for the food, we\\'ve had better. \\xa0The complimentary chips and salsa were skimpy. When asked for more salsa waiter replied \"we charge for additional salsa but I won\\'t charge you this time\". Well thanks for the no charge, definitely won\\'t be a next time to this restaurant. Big disappointment!'), (82, \"Mediocre food, mediocre service. Charged for what is standard at Mexican restaurants (first 'basket' of 15 chips is free, rest is a charge that shows up on your bill). Expensive entrees for what you get, quality-wise. Service people were polite but not attentive. We had to flag them down repeatedly for everything.\"), (83, 'I LOVE this place! Very good Mexican food! I love how they make the guacamole in front of you! & their margaritas are amazing!'), (84, \"Great ambiance, great food, great drinks. The best part was the service. I haven't received this type of service in a long time. Everything was on point. Check my profile, I don't give out five stars frequently... this spot earned it.\"), (85, \"Our first stop in NYC wasn't a dissapointment. A quaint little place, colorful and full of personality. The service was excellent, nothing says welcomed like your waiter folding your napkin on your laugh. We ordered birthday margaritas and they were delicious, a single flame burning lime floating on a balanced strawberry drink---absolutely perfect. The food was authentic and flavorful. The chicken margarita quesadilla was satisfying and crisp. The falutas also fried perfectly, with fresh cheese ontop. Definitely would come again.\"), (86, \"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in the city. It has that neighborhood feel and it's not trendy at all, which I love. They serve all the classics: fajitas, burritos, enchiladas...If you live in the Upper East Side and craving guacamole, this is your spot! \"), (87, \"The drinks were cute and good with the little flame in it wasn't expecting it. \"), (88, 'One of my favorite go to Mexican Restaurants. I live on the Upper West Side, and have made the trek across town to eat here.'), (89, '$6 margaritas from 12-7pm? In the UES? That sounds too good to be true and that was my exact reaction when I saw that. Their margaritas are on point and so is their chips and salsa. Also they make their guan table side. How cool is that?'), (90, 'The food was amazing and inexpensive! Wide variety of items on the menu, awesome ambience and super attentive staff. We will definitely come back!'), (91, \"This place was bangin' \"), (92, 'Stopped by here for an early dinner before a show since we had a '), (93, 'One of my favorite spots on the UES! The staff are always very friendly and the ambiance is great. I usually come here for their flaming drinks and tamales. Sometimes they even have live music which is a nice touch.'), (94, \"For some reason, my coworkers like to frequent this place. I've been unimpressed with the food and drinks. I've ordered the Enchiladas Con Queso twice, and also had the Fresh Guacamole numerous times. I've found the enchiladas heavy and not that flavorful, and the chips to be average. They make the guacamole fresh on front of you which is nice--I've never been that into guacamole though so maybe that's why I don't appreciate it. I've also tried a bunch of their drinks (sangria, margaritas, mojitos), which come in numerous fruity flavors (my go to is mango). They are very sugary/salty/spicy (depending on which drink you order), which is not my style as I prefer my drinks to be more smooth. \"), (95, \"I was expecting this restaurant to be a lot better based off the food, but we had a below average experience when we came. It was kinda busy in there, but the waitress completely got our margaritas wrong, adding salt when we asked for none and when we asked for a specific liquor they didn't do it. \"), (96, \"Service: went on a Friday night. Service was attentive and nice but nothing over th top. No free shots or tequila poured into our mouths like many reviews here but we didn't feel rushed and did feel taken care of. \"), (97, 'Poor management. Service has declined over last couple years. I tried to use my rebate from '), (98, 'This place was so good down to the drinks food and service.The prices are affordable foe such good food and drinks thumbs up see recommend happy hour everyday 6$ drinks cant beat that.'), (99, 'This place is amazing. Their food, drinks, desserts, and even atmosphere are all perfect. Very authentic on flavors and presentations.'), (100, 'Great happy hour for starters, they have every kind of marg you can think of and the food is very good, not to mention the table side guacamole....
