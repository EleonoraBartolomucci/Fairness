There were 6-7 large shrimp, perfectly complimented with poblano peppers and onions, in a red cream sauce served with refried beans, rice, guacamole, and lettuce. The shrimp were clearly fresh and substantial in size. We had our choice of flour and corn tortillas and we decided to try both.

After getting a tip from tour guide about a place called Lindo Michoacan that was &#34;a little out of the way,&#34; we decided to look it up on Yelp. After reading a few reviews with words like &#34;favorite Mexican&#34; and &#34;best in Vegas,&#34; we knew we had found the right place and headed over.<br><br>Lindo Michoacan, which is located on Desert Inn Road between 515 and Eastern Avenue, is a large stand alone venue with a large horse statute standing outside to greet you in. We went inside and found a packed venue that can be best described as being a mixture of a hole in the wall and a large beautiful Mexican restaurant. I know those sound like polar opposites, but this venue pulls it off well.<br><br>We were seated at our table and our server came over to bring us menus and say hello. He was very friendly, gave us great recommendations and, despite being very busy, was great about checking up on us throughout the meal. While other service we received in Vegas may have been technically better, his passion, hustle and friendliness made for some of the best service we received in Vegas.<br><br>After looking over the venue&#39;s massive menu, we put in an order for a couple margaritas (I got one that our server described as the &#34;Cadillac of margaritas&#34;) to start. Our margaritas came out relatively quickly and were both tasty and strong, something both me and my wife greatly appreciated. <br><br>As we were working on our margaritas, one of the servers brought out some chips and dip. The chips were some of the best chips I&#39;ve had at a Mexican restaurant in a while, and the dark green bean dip was outstanding. The server also brought out the Queso Fundido (with lobster meat) that we ordered due to our waiter&#39;s strong recommendation. The appetizer was absolutely fantastic and served as another excellent dipping option for our chips...to the point we were getting full before our entrees had even made it out!<br><br>Fortunately, the waiter waited a little while before bringing out our main dishes. Once they came out, the sight and smell of them renewed our appetites. I ordered the Carnitas a la Coca Cola (once again based on the waiter&#39;s recommendation). It came with refried beans, a guac salad and veggies in place of the rice. The carnitas were absolutely delicious in that they were sweet, tender, juicy and just overall excellent. The veggies were also great and the guac salad made for another dipping option for our chips. My wife loved her food as well, and the only bad part was our stomachs were running out of room. Fortunately, we were able to box up our food, get the check (all for less than $70! what a steal compared to the rest of Vegas) and head out to catch our flight. <br><br>Overall, Lindo Michoacan is a fantastic authentic Mexican restaurant.

The menu is quite extensive, they have so many entrée options for chicken, beef, pork, seafood, vegetarian and soup, and they make specialty drinks and offer tasty desserts.<br><br>For starter, they serve you with complimentary tortilla chips, salsa, and bean dip. The homemade tortilla chips taste fresh. I love the mild smokey spiciness of the salsa, and the bean dip is serve warm and creamy. I went for Apatzingan and chose two Chicken Enchiladas ($13.25), it comes with Spanish Rice, Refried Beans, Guacamole, and I requested for Pico De Gallo and Avocado Slice. I really like my meal, the food is so flavorful especially when adding more of the smokey red salsa. The entree comes with Fideo Soup, which is a tomato based soup with chicken broth and Fideo Noodles. It&#39;s delicious! <br><br>For dessert I tried the Lindo Flameado ($8.25) which is a flaming fried vanilla ice cream ball coated with crush cereal and serve with sweet caramelize banana. When it arrive to my table, the dessert is literally on fire. I attempt to try eating it while it&#39;s on flame and then one of the server glance toward me giving me the signal to blow out the fire first. Well that makes a lot more sense. My first attempt blowing out the fire didn&#39;t work, it came right back. It took me three times to make sure the fire was out, and by that time the bottom of the Fried Ice Cream Ball is already charred. I think this particular dessert is entertaining to look at, but it is a lot to eat for one person. If you do decide to order this, make sure you have someone to share it with. Overall I feel the dining experience is good and the service is quick and efficient. What&#39;s more enjoyable is when they gather around you and you start hearing them sing a Happy Birthday Song, they will make you feel truly special.'), ('GgfzJbfgwyBWeEgL3bYPQg', 'Terrific food and service<br>Were able to accommodate food allergies <br>I asked which were better carnitas Michoacan or Chile verde. \\xa0They gave me 1/2 orders of both<br>Both were great but the Chile Verde melted in my mouth. \\xa0Thx!!!!!'), ('E8-CNSY5Mp4Cp3FE8Ap6qw', 'Probably the best mexican food I&#39;ve ever ate.

I mean, rice and beans with chips and salsa on the table, and not small tapas or modern style Mexican food that&#39;s going to cost me next months rent. <br><br>When we came in we were friendly greeted by the hosts who promptly sat us as a table. Not only were we greeted by our server quickly, but we also had a very attentive busperson who frequently came to check on us. She refilled our drinks before they were empty, and would check on us frequently to make sure everything was okay and we had everything we needed. <br><br>A few minutes after reviewing the menu, we were greeted by our server who was very informative about the menu. He was quick to give recommendations when asked and quickly delivered hot chips and spicy salsa which a side of creamy refried beans! I was in love with the slight kick their red salsa came in, and knowing it&#39;s not their spiciest makes me even happier!<br><br>There&#39;s is one thing that I love.... spicy food! When we came in and I realized this place is known for the spiciest dish in Las Vegas... I had to try it. <br><br>Few had stated that their servers had persuaded them to eat something differently because of the spiciness. Our server stated that on a scale from 1-10, this was a 50.... so I ordered it, of course. And he wasn&#39;t lying. Even though I asked for half of my carnitas to be the Cry Today Cry Tomorrow, I quickly was holding back tears and my entire mouth from my lips to my gums had gone numb from the ghost peppers. Now, those who love spicy food will roll their eyes and come here to try it anyways, which I respect and encourage! If you can handle it. It is worth trying one time. The carnitas melt in your mouth and that flavor is irreplaceable. HOWEVER! It&#39;s been over 24 hours and my stomach is still upset from having a half portion of their ghost pepper salsa. So, if eating a raw jalapeño is too hard for you, just ask for a side of the Cry Today Cry Tomorrow salsa to try with your chips first. <br><br>On a side note!

He was pretty decent and it added a nice touch to the meal. The other great thing is that, if it is your birthday (or close enough), if you tell the server, they will come out, put a sombrero on you and sing to you. The song is finished with the birthday person taking a shot of tequila and getting a birthday churro. Honestly, the churro was probably just for decoration as it was the hardest grossest churro I&#39;ve ever had, but it&#39;s the thought that counts. <br><br>Overall, I really enjoyed the place.

We arrived at 4:50pm on a Friday which turned out to be 10 minutes before happy hour ended. The restaurant was already getting busy, and our server scrambled to make sure we got our drinks at the happy hour half-price which we appreciated very much - $5.00 for Javier&#39;s Margarita and $2.75 for an ice-cold pint of draft Pacifico. These happy hour drink prices alone make OLM one of the best values in Las Vegas, and as we perused the fantastic menu with many dishes we had never seen or heard of before it looked like we were heading into an easy 5-star experience. The food, unfortunately, changed all that.<br><br>When we were seated we were served fresh tortilla chips, warm bean dip, and pinkish salsa that had a bit of a bite. I thought all were great but my GF thought the salsa tasted odd and &#34;off&#34; somehow. <br><br>For the past several days we had been doing a Queso Fundido with chorizo tour around Las Vegas, trying this dish at a variety of area Mexican restaurants, and we were looking forward to trying OLM&#39;s version. OLM charges $8.50 for plain Queso Fundido and you can add chorizo for $1.00 more. We ordered this and when it arrived we could see no chorizo in the dish. We poked around in it and it turned out they had put a tiny amount (perhaps a bit less than a teaspoon) of chorizo underneath the top layer of cheese. The tiny crumbles of chorizo we were able to locate were barely enough to taste, but when we did get a taste it was very good. To the management of Original Lindo Michoacan: we would gladly have paid an extra $2.50 for a decent amount of chorizo in your Queso Fundido. This is typically what your competitors charge for a more generous amount, and by charging only $1.00 for this and then appearing to skimp on it and not really deliver it to your customers you are shooting yourselves in the foot.<br><br>After drinks, chips, and queso we were getting full and we really had no room left for a huge plate of food. So we ordered a single, a la carte Al Pastor taco in order to see how well OLM does with Al Pastor which is another one of our Mexican favorites. We have had some absolutely spectacular Al Pastor in Las Vegas at many restaurants and taco shops, and again we were looking forward to tasting OLM&#39;s version.<br><br>The taco arrived and it was pathetic. It was really just little nuggets of gristly pork fat with virtually no Al Pastor flavor or color at all. Ugh. We were left wondering how a restaurant with the reputation and following that OLM has could fail so badly with this Mexican staple. Oh well. <br><br>Original Lindo Michoacan gets 3.5 stars for our first visit. They had everything in place for an easy 5 stars but the kitchen made sure that didn&#39;t happen. We are willing to return once more during happy hour to give their kitchen another chance by trying some other items on their really interesting menu, and to again enjoy some of their well-priced drinks. However, we now realize that Original Lindo Michoacan may emerge as the best choice for happy hour drinks only, and at 5:00pm we&#39;ll need to move on to another place for some Mexican food.'), ('3sXDU30mQprwi_8qDe5HiA', 'About 30 of us came in from out of town to celebrate my mom&#39;s 60th birthday. \\xa0I did a little research trying to find an amazing Mexican Restaurant and hit the bulls-eye! \\xa0<br><br>AWESOME customer service! \\xa0<br><br>Every time I called the restaurant to coordinate or ask questions about our upcoming dinner, they were super friendly and appeasing! \\xa0They had no problem letting me bring in a cake and actually let me drop it off the evening before to keep in their refrigerator (sneaking in the back door so I didn&#39;t have to get caught up in the huge line upfront)! <br><br>It was just a wonderful experience - the staff was fun, polite and very attentive! \\xa0<br><br>The food was great - \\xa0I wasn&#39;t the biggest fan of what I had ordered (Gallo al Mojo de Ajo - just wasn&#39;t my cup of tea) but ended up nibbling off of my mom&#39;s burrito (and taking the rest back to my hotel) and it was AMAZING! \\xa0<br><br>The best part of the night was when they came out to sing Happy Birthday to my mom, aunt and great uncle (who turned 80!). \\xa0They must have had pretty much the whole staff come out to sing with surprise tequila shots! \\xa0I had read some of the reviews before and so I knew it was going to happen, but totally blanked until moments before! \\xa0I just wished I had grabbed my phone to record it because it was HILARIOUS!!! \\xa0<br><br>Thank you for such a wonderful time and thank you for the awesome customer service!!!'), ('lCYaXiAQVY6vq2awuO2Siw', 'This place is the reason I moved to Vegas.

But anyway I came here for dinner and drinks with some coworkers. They had mango margaritas which were tasty (and I don&#39;t even like mango) and I had a watermelon margarita which was very good. I could hardly choose what to get but settled on the Steak Ranchera (about $20) and it was delicious. They also bring you chips and salsa of course which were good but the little cup of sopa de fideo they bring before your entree was friggin amazing. I need to figure out how to make it like that cuz it was the bomb, I could just have a big bowl of that in the winter, with some tortillas.... mmmm.

Tried calling some restaurants serving american food, and they wanted a deposit and give a special menu, I was stressing out trying to find a location that would accommodate about 20 people. The thing about my party is that most of them are Japanese since my now wife is Japanese, so trying to accommodate every one with food choices. But come remember that they all love Mexican food. So I found this place on yelp and called to see what they could do for me. To my surprise, no special menu, no deposit and every one got there on check. But the best part was when we show up and they ask for me and my wife to go in last. They sat all our guest, and then let us in. As we came in they had the mariachi playing for us!

Not because we were slow, not because we were chatting.. no because service was that awful. An hour to take our order, an hour to drop the check, etc, etc. You expect bad service on Cindo de mayo, but wow they really knocked it out of the park. <br><br>The first margarita from the bar was ok. Not great, ok. It tasted like it had some tequila in it, it cost $5, whatever, I was happy. We then proceeded to order margaritas at the table and like others have said - it was a glass of cheap nasty margarita mix. I consider myself an expert margarita drinker (5+ years in Houston will do that for ya!) and these were abysmal . I&#39;d be shocked if they had more than 1/4 shot each of tequila and the mix they use is gross. A margarita with no tequila isn&#39;t worth $5, its worth $0!! Please just charge me $7 or something and actually put tequila in it. <br><br>I know there was some drama in our group about the spicy guac, but from a mild girl&#39;s perspective, the tableside guac was delish! If you don&#39;t like it hot you&#39;ll probably be very happy with the guac here. <br><br>I&#39;m giving them 3 stars because the rest of the food was actually pretty good. The husband and I split the beef crispy taco and flank steak. Flank steak is actually pretty easy to screw up. Theirs was shockingly good. It actually came out medium rare. The flavoring was perfect. Portion was huge. Very damn pleased with our flank steak. Crispy taco was also bada**. Oh and lastly I&#39;m a sucker for GOOD homemade tortillas. Their&#39;s were fabulous.

I was one of the last guests to arrive and the waiter was getting everyone&#39;s drinks, I had a slight hesitation when he asked me and before I know it, he already was on the next guest. He also kept going back to me asking me, very sternly, if I was ready to order, wanting me to make a decision. After the third time, I said I was ready, but mind you, he wasn&#39;t really taking any order, he just wanted to know if we were ready. At this point, I was already peeved. And, he also managed to annoy half of our party. One of our party had a specific order and this was repeated 3x, twice in English and once in Spanish. When his order came, he was surprised that it was wrong. He pointed this out to our server and our server told him they can scoop it out for him or hand him a spoon to do it himself. After some deliberation, he gave the plate back and said he does not want the food anymore. At this point, the server called him an &#34;a-hole&#34; in Spanish, NOT KNOWING HE IS FLUENT IN SPANISH! The manager was called and talked to our friend and only then when this server came over to &#34;personally apologize.&#34; I do not believe it was sincere at all since he only have done so since he got caught! There was no compensation, that I was aware of the same server kept serving us. I was not happy about his service and wished we did not leave any tip/gratuity towards him. I would have left it to the bus boys. <br><br>Big question, will I go back? I would only go back if a friend, who also speaks Spanish, wanted to go.

We couldn&#39;t agree with him more. Stephanie who we worked with for about a year delivered on everything we talked about over the phone. She was absolutely amazing! We had our spin to a traditional wedding reception on a Friday from 2-5pm during the lunch period and our guest selected 1 of 4 \\xa0lunch items that we pre-selected that came with rice, beans, salad or soup, and a soft drink. \\xa0Stephanie was nice enough to create the specialized menu with our names on it. It was also happy hour so the drinks were half off. The food during the lunch period is very affordable.<br><br>When we arrived at the restaurant they reserved the entire back area for us. The customer service was absolutely out of this world. They had several servers helping us. They also sang a happy wedding song to us, put sombrero&#39;s on our head, gave us a shot of tequila and had us eat churro.

The space is enormous and they also have a nice bar (which I did not visit), so even if there was a wait, I can&#39;t imagine it would be long. <br><br>We were seated at an intimate semi-circle booth. I was quickly drawn to the authentic vibe of the space - great decor and great music. Within seconds we were greeted by our waiter, who informed us about the happy hour specials.

I was a fan of all three and I typically do not care for refried beans. <br><br>When I started to explore the menu, I was a bit overwhelmed. Think Cheesecake Factory.

Therefore, I enlisted the assistance of the waiter. I asked for his advice on the best camarones (shrimp) dishes. He recommended three and I decided on the Camarones Rajas Crema. <br><br>While we were ordering, someone sneak attack delivered complimentary sopa de Fideo; tasty broth with thin, short noodles. Definitely a nice start to the meal. And I am completely serious when I say I did not even see it be placed in front of me. <br><br>It didn&#39;t take long for our entrees to arrive. The Camarones Rajas Crema was visually appealing and tasted even better. There were 6-7 large shrimp, perfectly complimented with poblano peppers and onions, in a red cream sauce served with refried beans, rice, guacamole, and lettuce. The shrimp were clearly fresh and substantial in size. We had our choice of flour and corn tortillas and we decided to try both.

After getting a tip from tour guide about a place called Lindo Michoacan that was &#34;a little out of the way,&#34; we decided to look it up on Yelp. After reading a few reviews with words like &#34;favorite Mexican&#34; and &#34;best in Vegas,&#34; we knew we had found the right place and headed over.<br><br>Lindo Michoacan, which is located on Desert Inn Road between 515 and Eastern Avenue, is a large stand alone venue with a large horse statute standing outside to greet you in. We went inside and found a packed venue that can be best described as being a mixture of a hole in the wall and a large beautiful Mexican restaurant. I know those sound like polar opposites, but this venue pulls it off well.<br><br>We were seated at our table and our server came over to bring us menus and say hello. He was very friendly, gave us great recommendations and, despite being very busy, was great about checking up on us throughout the meal. While other service we received in Vegas may have been technically better, his passion, hustle and friendliness made for some of the best service we received in Vegas.<br><br>After looking over the venue&#39;s massive menu, we put in an order for a couple margaritas (I got one that our server described as the &#34;Cadillac of margaritas&#34;) to start. Our margaritas came out relatively quickly and were both tasty and strong, something both me and my wife greatly appreciated. <br><br>As we were working on our margaritas, one of the servers brought out some chips and dip. The chips were some of the best chips I&#39;ve had at a Mexican restaurant in a while, and the dark green bean dip was outstanding. The server also brought out the Queso Fundido (with lobster meat) that we ordered due to our waiter&#39;s strong recommendation. The appetizer was absolutely fantastic and served as another excellent dipping option for our chips...to the point we were getting full before our entrees had even made it out!<br><br>Fortunately, the waiter waited a little while before bringing out our main dishes. Once they came out, the sight and smell of them renewed our appetites. I ordered the Carnitas a la Coca Cola (once again based on the waiter&#39;s recommendation). It came with refried beans, a guac salad and veggies in place of the rice. The carnitas were absolutely delicious in that they were sweet, tender, juicy and just overall excellent. The veggies were also great and the guac salad made for another dipping option for our chips. My wife loved her food as well, and the only bad part was our stomachs were running out of room. Fortunately, we were able to box up our food, get the check (all for less than $70! what a steal compared to the rest of Vegas) and head out to catch our flight. <br><br>Overall, Lindo Michoacan is a fantastic authentic Mexican restaurant.

Got sat right away, ambience was great and reminded me of my favorite Mexican restaurant in California that went out of business. Their chips and salsa are to die for--I mean seriously, like the best salsa I have ever had. They bring bean dip too. The lunch specials are amazing as well.

Normally, I stray away from ordering this dish at restaurants I have not been to, but this was just ridiculous. When I typically order it, there&#39;s fat on the meat. In this case? Nope, not one bit. So so tender and delicious. Their corn tortillas are incredible too. My server Miguel was awesome! I hope to get him next time I come in.

Our server stated that on a scale from 1-10, this was a 50.... so I ordered it, of course. And he wasn&#39;t lying. Even though I asked for half of my carnitas to be the Cry Today Cry Tomorrow, I quickly was holding back tears and my entire mouth from my lips to my gums had gone numb from the ghost peppers. Now, those who love spicy food will roll their eyes and come here to try it anyways, which I respect and encourage! If you can handle it. It is worth trying one time. The carnitas melt in your mouth and that flavor is irreplaceable. HOWEVER! It&#39;s been over 24 hours and my stomach is still upset from having a half portion of their ghost pepper salsa. So, if eating a raw jalapeño is too hard for you, just ask for a side of the Cry Today Cry Tomorrow salsa to try with your chips first. <br><br>On a side note!

He said, &#34;it&#39;s because the machines process debit cards as a credit card.&#34; I then told him that sounds like their problem, not the customers problem. I also told him debit cards do not require an I.D. due to the card requiring the customer to input the PIN # that signifies it&#39;s their card. I then asked him how would he handle the situation had we not provided an I.D. &amp; he said, &#34;I don&#39;t know.&#34; However, he claimed they started this change in policy last month. As a manager you should have the skill set to problem solve &amp; exceed the customers expectations. Not only did Louis have no answers, he was unable to come close to meeting my expectations.

The drinks, especially the Margaritas, are perfect. Especially the organic Margarita. Once you place your order, they bring you a small bowl of fideo.

We arrived at 4:50pm on a Friday which turned out to be 10 minutes before happy hour ended. The restaurant was already getting busy, and our server scrambled to make sure we got our drinks at the happy hour half-price which we appreciated very much - $5.00 for Javier&#39;s Margarita and $2.75 for an ice-cold pint of draft Pacifico. These happy hour drink prices alone make OLM one of the best values in Las Vegas, and as we perused the fantastic menu with many dishes we had never seen or heard of before it looked like we were heading into an easy 5-star experience. The food, unfortunately, changed all that.<br><br>When we were seated we were served fresh tortilla chips, warm bean dip, and pinkish salsa that had a bit of a bite. I thought all were great but my GF thought the salsa tasted odd and &#34;off&#34; somehow. <br><br>For the past several days we had been doing a Queso Fundido with chorizo tour around Las Vegas, trying this dish at a variety of area Mexican restaurants, and we were looking forward to trying OLM&#39;s version. OLM charges $8.50 for plain Queso Fundido and you can add chorizo for $1.00 more. We ordered this and when it arrived we could see no chorizo in the dish. We poked around in it and it turned out they had put a tiny amount (perhaps a bit less than a teaspoon) of chorizo underneath the top layer of cheese. The tiny crumbles of chorizo we were able to locate were barely enough to taste, but when we did get a taste it was very good. To the management of Original Lindo Michoacan: we would gladly have paid an extra $2.50 for a decent amount of chorizo in your Queso Fundido. This is typically what your competitors charge for a more generous amount, and by charging only $1.00 for this and then appearing to skimp on it and not really deliver it to your customers you are shooting yourselves in the foot.<br><br>After drinks, chips, and queso we were getting full and we really had no room left for a huge plate of food. So we ordered a single, a la carte Al Pastor taco in order to see how well OLM does with Al Pastor which is another one of our Mexican favorites. We have had some absolutely spectacular Al Pastor in Las Vegas at many restaurants and taco shops, and again we were looking forward to tasting OLM&#39;s version.<br><br>The taco arrived and it was pathetic. It was really just little nuggets of gristly pork fat with virtually no Al Pastor flavor or color at all. Ugh. We were left wondering how a restaurant with the reputation and following that OLM has could fail so badly with this Mexican staple. Oh well. <br><br>Original Lindo Michoacan gets 3.5 stars for our first visit. They had everything in place for an easy 5 stars but the kitchen made sure that didn&#39;t happen. We are willing to return once more during happy hour to give their kitchen another chance by trying some other items on their really interesting menu, and to again enjoy some of their well-priced drinks.

We sat at the bar because it was lunchtime so obviously we knew it was going to be packed. The bartender was really nice and served us right away...then it all went downhill. My boyfriend order the chicken crema y rajas, i ordered shrimp mojo de ajo. When the food came out, mine was chicken instead of shrimp so I sent it back and the bartender apologized.

When I looked at WHAT was on my plate .....it was the poorest excuse of ajo I have ever seen in my life!!!! Very watery, no garlic, it tasted like lemon water with a bit of tomato!!! I know this dish well since I order it all the time. At this point i start getting mad!!! The bartender said she was going to get the manager which we waited and waited and waited and waited but she was too busy getting chips for the five gentlemen that were seated at the bar next to us.

The other great thing is that, if it is your birthday (or close enough), if you tell the server, they will come out, put a sombrero on you and sing to you. The song is finished with the birthday person taking a shot of tequila and getting a birthday churro. Honestly, the churro was probably just for decoration as it was the hardest grossest churro I&#39;ve ever had, but it&#39;s the thought that counts. <br><br>Overall, I really enjoyed the place.

When it was time for the bill I told one of the drink servers to have the price of my salad reduced by $2.25 (the cheapest cost for sides at the restaurant) because the bacon never came.

The server tried to give me a free dessert again, so I asked to speak to the manager myself.

And the ice cream cost $6. So sad...'), ('NrHIf3HMm8l27TS2abNV6A', 'UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE:<br>Since I worte my last review of thi splace, I hace since gone back. I went this past Labor day weekend for lunch. I am so very very disappointed. The menu prices have gone up so much. Lunch and dinner used to be a decent price, now they have gone up nearly 2 bucks for each entree. They also used to include a small bowl of soup with lunch, now it is 4.95 for it!!!! On top of all this, they provide only ONE refill of your beverage at lunch. So sad that the owners seem to have gotten very greedy and began to overprice. Despite this being one of my favorite Mexican resturants of all time, the price, quality and greed will not allow me to go back. I will look for something new.<br><br>You may never find another Mexican food resturant like this. WOW WOW WOW!!!!! \\xa0The food, awsome, the service, awsome, the price, awsome. \\xa0This family has done so well, and knows how to treat a customer!')]\n",
